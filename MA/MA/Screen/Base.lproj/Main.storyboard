A part of flight training that you will find both interesting and different is flying at night. 

In just a moment, we'll take a brief night flight and cover the major aspects of night flying for pilots who have flown only during daylight. 

We'll introduce you to night vision, airport lighting, and give you tips to help you with your night flying experience. You'll find that night flying is enjoyable since the air usually will be calm and smooth. 

For your private certificate, you must have at least three hours of night dual instruction that includes a cross-country flight of over 100 nautical miles and 10 takeoffs and 10 full-stop landings. 

Night flying is considered to be an important phase in the complete training of a pilot. A pilot who becomes proficient in night flying gains valuable experience in case of an intended day flight that inadvertently extends into darkness. 

Remember that night flying is not really difficult, but it differs from daylight operations in that vision is restricted at night. 

You will be challenged by the fact that you cannot see as well at night as during the day. However, there are techniques you can learn to enhance your night vision. For example, during the day the best way to see something is by looking directly at it. 

But at night, dim objects are best seen by viewing them slightly off center. This is due to the way the rods and cones in the retina of your eyes function. 

You'll practice what's called dark adaptation. This is simply avoiding bright white light before you fly to let your eyes adjust to the dark. 

This is similar to what you experience when entering a darkened theater or room. At first you can hardly see, but within four or five minutes, objects start to become visible, and after thirty minutes you are dark adapted. 

To help maintain dark adaptation, keep the cockpit and instrument lights adjusted to allow you to best see out of and inside the airplane. 

When over a brightly lighted area like a large city, turn up the instrument lighting. Eyes never function as effectively at night as during the day. But remember that if pilots learn to use dark adaptation techniques correctly, then night vision can be greatly improved. 

As part of a night preflight, you must make sure the airplane lighting system works. This includes checking the position or navigation lights which are red for the left or port wingtip, green for the right or starboard wingtip and white for the tail. 

Also check the anti-collision lights and the landing lights for proper operation. Next check the instrument panel lights. 

If the airplane's electrical system has fuses, federal aviation regulations require a spare set or three spares of each kind to be on board. 

At night it's recommended you have a flashlight in good operating condition on board as a back-up in case of an electrical system problem. Keep it handy so you don't have to search around in a suddenly darkened cockpit. 

Some pilots use a small flashlight that can be carried in a shirt pocket or hung around the neck. As you and your instructor taxi out for your night orientation flight, the first thing you'll notice is how different the airport appears. 

Taxi slowly, especially if you are in a congested parking area. If the taxiway is lighted, it will have blue lights. 

As you taxi, you will probably notice the airport beacon flashing alternately white and green. Alternating white and green flashes identify a lighted, land airport for civilian use. 

Military airports have beacons that show two quick white flashes between green flashes. You might also notice some red lights. These mark buildings and obstructions in the airport area. 
 
Once in the run-up area, your instructor will probably have you turn off the landing lights to conserve electrical energy and to not ruin the night vision of other nearby pilots. 

Do a very thorough run-up using the checklist and be sure the generator or alternator is functioning. 

When ready to taxi for take-off, turn on the landing and anti-collision lights. Ask for tower clearance, or check the area carefully at non-towered airports. 

As you start to taxi towards the active runway, you'll notice that the runway threshold or end of the runway is marked with green lights. 

Some airports have runway threshold lights that are green on the approach side, and red on the runway side to alert pilots on roll out from the opposite direction they are near the end of the runway. 

You may also see pulsating white strobe lights. These are runway end identifier lights. Runways are edge-lighted with white lights. 

Once in the middle of the runway, check to ensure the heading indicator and runway headings are the same. 

Apply power smoothly and use the runway lights and the landing lights as a reference to help maintain direction. 

Check the heading indicator as you accelerate to the normal lift off speed. Your first impression will be you're moving faster than usual. This is due to the lack of visual clues used in the day to help judge speed. 

At lift-off speed, apply back pressure to rotate to climb attitude. Use the same airspeeds you do during the day, and adjust engine power as required for your airplane. 

Keep checking your heading indicator, attitude indicator, and vertical speed indicator as you climb. 

Look out for other air traffic as you climb. The location of navigation lights on aircraft is to help pilots see as well as determine the direction of other aircraft. 

For example, if you see an airplane's red light, you have the left wingtip in view and it is passing from your right to your left and has the right of way. 

If you see a white light and a flashing red or white light, you are looking at the tail of an airplane. A green light indicates you are seeing an airplane’s right wing and it is moving from your left to right, and you have the right of way. 

An aircraft displaying both red and green lights will be approaching head on. An easy way to remember the right of way rules at night is: if you see green, you have the right of way. If you see red, you do not. 

You might have a question as to when to turn on navigation or position lights. Regulations specifically state that navigation lights must be on anytime an airplane is taxiing or flying during the entire period from sunset to sunrise. 

They further state that from sunset to sunrise, an aircraft may not be parked or moved in a night flight operations area of an airport unless the aircraft is clearly illuminated, has lighted position lights, or is in an area which is marked by obstruction lights. 

Don't confuse sunset to sunrise to mean night. The period between sunset and sunrise is not necessarily all night as defined by the regulations. 

Night is defined in the regulations as the time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight. By this definition, night begins sometime after sunset, and ends sometime before sunrise. 

At night, it's important to know your position at all times when away from the airport. Use radio navigation backed up with dead reckoning. Ask for help from A-T-C if necessary. 

Remember that visual navigation landmarks simply cannot be seen at night out over the dark country. Radio control of runway lighting is available at selected airports by keying the airplane's microphone on the appropriate frequency. 

It is recommended to click the microphone 7 times within 5 seconds to activate the highest intensity lights available. If the lights are adjustable, you may want to reduce their intensity by clicking the microphone an additional 5 times. Once activated, the runway lights remain illuminated for 15 minutes from the time of the most recent activation. 

As you approach an airport, pick out the threshold and runway lights for the active runway. Keep them in sight as you enter the pattern. 

Complete the pre-landing checklist. On final approach, check that the runway heading and heading indicator agree. 

At night you will find it's difficult to judge height and speed above the ground. Use the same approach airspeeds as in the day and make sure you're not low and slow or high and fast. On a low approach, the runway looks like this. 

A high approach looks like this, and on a proper approach flight-path, this is what you should see. 

Use the landing lights to aid in determining when to start the flare for touchdown. Don't stare at the area lighted by the landing lights; use the runway edge-lights also for landing clues. Again, use power to control your descent to the runway, and reduce it to idle at touchdown. 

Landing without landing lights is more difficult, but start to round out when you see the runway lights at the far end appear to rise above the airplane. 

Because of limited visibility at night, use caution, and taxi slowly to your parking destination. 

Many runways have visual glide slope indicators to help pilots during landing approaches. VASI, or visual approach slope indicator, is a lighting system which provides visual descent information to a runway. 

Two bar VASI's can be seen from about 3 to 5 miles during the day and up to 20 miles at night. When properly positioned on the VASI, the aircraft will have safe obstruction clearance within plus or minus ten degrees of the extended runway centerline, and to four nautical miles from the runway threshold. 

When using VASI, a descent should not be started until the airplane is aligned visually with the runway. The runway or runway lights are used for proper course guidance. 

The most commonly installed VASI consists of two bars, near and far, situated alongside the runway. The basis of VASI is simply identifying the color difference between red and white. You see either red or white from either bar depending on height. 

If you see white, you will touch down after passing abeam of that bar. If you see red, you will touch down before passing abeam of that bar. 

Since the goal is to touch down between the near bar and the far bar, some pilots remember proper orientation with VASI by using the phrase, “If you see red over white, you are all right.” This means you are on the proper glide path. 

Unless required for obstruction clearance, all visual glide slope indicators are set to provide a visual glide path that is 3 degrees to the horizontal. 

A pilot on the correct glide path using a two bar VASI, would see the far bar as red and the near bar as white. Below the glide path both bars would be red, and above the glide path both bars would be white. A system with all light units installed in a single row is called a precision approach path indicator, spoken PAPI (pappy) for short. 

If you can use a VASI, the PAPI's ‘gonna’ be a snap. There are 2 and 4-light systems. We'll begin with the 2-light version. 

Just like the VASI, what you're shooting for is a combination of red and white. If both lights are white, you're too high. If you see all red, you're too low. 

The 4-light PAPI system gives you varying degrees of high and low. The more white you see, the higher you are. 

The more red you see, the lower you are. If you see all red, you might be dead, a morbid reminder. This is something you don't want to see using a PAPI or a VASI. You may also see a tri-color visual glide slope indicator. 

It's a single light unit that shows the pilot a three-color visual approach path to the runway on which the indicator is installed. 

If you are on the glide path you'll see green. Below the glide path, you'll see red. Above the glide path you'll see amber. 

Be aware when using this system if you descend from green to red you may see a dark amber color as you transition from green to red. Likewise, as you ascend from red to green, you may see the dark amber color as you transition. 

The useful range is about one-half to one mile during the day and up to five miles at night depending on visibility conditions. 

During the day or night, a pilot can experience many different illusions in flight and some can lead to landing errors. 

Surface features and atmospheric conditions can create illusions that mislead your ability to properly judge height above and distance from a runway threshold. 

Some are common to both day and night, and if you remember from Volume Three they are caused by narrow, wide, up-sloping and down-sloping runways, and atmospheric conditions such as rain, haze or snow. 

At night, there are some additional illusions in flight and some can lead to landing errors. For example, when landing over darkened areas the illusion can be that the airplane is higher than it actually is. 

Also, straight lights along a road can be mistaken for runway lights. Plus, bright runway lights with few lights illuminating the surrounding area may create the illusion of less distance to the runway. 

Conversely, dim runway lights with few lights illuminating the surrounding area to provide height information, may cause a pilot to fly a lower than normal approach. 

At night, inexperienced pilots often have a tendency to make approaches and landings with excessive airspeed. Every effort should be made to execute the approach and landing in the same manner as done during the day. 

Be aware of these illusions and anticipate them during approaches and use visual glide slope indicators when they are available.

It won’t take long for you to figure out after your first night flight that things are different in the dark. But there is no reason that night flying should be any more difficult than flying in the daytime, it's just different. 

There are not a lot of regulatory differences while flying at night, but you will find it worthwhile to learn how to adjust some of your techniques and procedures for night flying. 

If you’ll be flying outside the local airport environment, always consider “what-if” scenarios in the unlikely event that you’ll need to make an emergency off-airport landing. 

Try to plan a route that takes you along populated and well-lit areas. If that’s not possible, at a bare minimum, try to avoid flying over inhospitable terrain at low altitudes.

You should always file and open a VFR flight plan at night with Flight Service so that your flight path is on record. It’s also a good idea to call up the local approach or center controller for ATC flight following. They’re typically not as busy at night and will be happy to accommodate.

You should pay close attention to the fact that things will look a lot different visually than what you’re accustomed to seeing in the daytime.

For example, if you take off and climb out over an area where there are few or no lights, maintaining attitude by visual reference to a horizon will be quite difficult, if not impossible. This is actually instrument flying, so you need the ability to do it safely.

Another example. In the daytime you are probably getting pretty good at estimating altitude in the pattern without looking at the altimeter. That doesn't work at night and frequent checks of the altimeter are required to verify safe altitude. 

The same thing goes for the base leg in the traffic pattern. It’s easy to verify a safe altitude during the day with a quick glance out the window. 

There’s a big difference at night, and you’ll want to keep an eye on the altimeter as your descend through the final legs in the pattern.

Pay particular attention to the lighting activation method in the airport/facility directory -- some airports use a separate frequency other than the CTAF, which can catch you off guard if not prepared. 

While lighting intensities will vary, you can’t go wrong with clicking the mic 7 times to activate the highest-intensity lighting. And make it a habit to reset the lighting again when on downwind to avoid it turning off when on base or short final.

As you make the turn to final, watch for the visual approach glide slope to come into view, in either the form of a VASI or PAPI. 

You should research the approach lighting during your preflight planning, and again, a quick glance at the airport facility/directory will tell you everything you need to know.

Make it a point to check the visual glideslope approach angle to each runway; the standard is 3 degrees, but you’ll sometimes see 3.5 or even 4 if there are obstacles nearby, which will require you to fly a steeper approach than normal.

Something else to consider when on final at night is that there is a better chance for wildlife to hang out near the runway as things cool off. 

You may want to fly a low pass down the runway to inspect for and clear any deer or rodents before circling around for a final landing.

Even though night flying requires a little extra preparation, you will find it very peaceful and rewarding. The air is almost always smooth and the views are incredible -- it really is a great time to fly.
























3. Publications and Charts
There are several FAA flight information publications you will use during your flying career. The Aeronautical Information Manual provides basic flight information and ATC procedures for safe flight in the U.S. National Airspace System. The AIM contains the fundamentals required to fly in the United States and provides instructional and educational material.

The AIM also contains items concerning medical factors and flight safety. The AIM is available by subscription and is updated approximately every 6 months.  It is also available as an electronic download or you can purchase a reprint of the AIM through Sporty's.

The Pilot/Controller Glossary is often bundled with the AIM.  This document contains a glossary of terms used in the air traffic control system.

Another operational publication you will use is the Chart Supplement.  This publication is issued in nine volumes for the U.S., Puerto Rico, Alaska and the Pacific, with each volume covering a specific geographic area. 

The Chart Supplement contains a wealth of information, including an Airport/Facility Directory (known as the A-F-D for short), aeronautical chart bulletins, VOR receiver test information, communication frequencies and telephone numbers for ATC facilities and airport taxiway diagrams. The A-F-D section of of the Chart Supplement is designed as a pilot's operational manual containing all airports, seaplane bases, and heliports open to the public.

Each volume is indexed alphabetically by state and city, and all pertinent information about an airport can be found in the A-F-D. This information includes detailed runway data, airport remarks, communications frequencies and nearby navigation aids. Get in the routine of checking the A-F-D when planning a trip to a new airport, as you’ll find information in this directory not contained in any other resource.

The Chart Supplement is updated every 56 days and is available in a variety of formats, including as a printed book and online in PDF format, searchable by airport from the FAA website. Many aviation apps also feature the digital A-F-D page right on the main airport information screen. 

During preflight planning, you will need to check the Notices to Airmen, called NOTAMs for short. These notices are considered essential to flight safety and contain information not known sufficiently in advance to publicize by other means.
NOTAMs as well as other current information pertinent to a flight are available from a variety of sources, including the FAA NOTAM web site, Flight Service and in mobile flight planning apps.

NOTAMs are classed as Domestic NOTAMs, Flight Data Center, or FDC, NOTAMs, International NOTAMs, or Military NOTAMs.          

Domestic NOTAMs, commonly referred to as NOTAM D, report changes of navaid status, runway conditions, airspace, personnel and equipment near or crossing runways, and other information essential for operations.

NOTAM Ds are classified by a keyword near the beginning of the NOTAM. For example, Apron for airport ramps, R-W-Y for runway, or Nav for a Navigation Aid. D NOTAMS are also issued for updates to special use airspace or other general airspace activity, like drone flights or planned fireworks.                      

FDC NOTAMs deal with regulatory information such as amendments to instrument approach procedures and other current aeronautical charts. They also disseminate information about temporary flight restrictions. FDC NOTAMs do not deal with navaid outages, runway conditions, and other non regulatory information.

International NOTAMs are issued for airports outside of the U.S. and are also available on the FAA’s NOTAM website and in several flight planning apps. These are presented in a standardized international format using keywords and abbreviations.

The last type, Military NOTAMs, are intended for users of a military or joint-use facility and are published in the International NOTAM format.  

Before we look at the charts, a word of caution – don't ever use out of date charts or publications because aeronautical data changes frequently. To be safe, check the effective dates and replace or update all out of date charts and publications.  

Consult the aeronautical chart bulletins in the Chart Supplement and NOTAM's for any changes that may have occurred during the effective dates of a chart or publication.

Some charts you'll become familiar with are VFR Sectional, VFR Terminal Area, and Flyway Planning Charts. Sectional charts are designed for visual navigation and are named for a major city within the area of coverage. You should have little difficulty in reading these charts since in many ways they are similar to automobile road maps.

These charts use a scale of 1 inch equals 6.86 nautical miles or 8 statute miles.  We'll take a closer look at Sectional charts in just a moment.

VFR Terminal Area charts are similar to Sectional charts in that they are designed for visual navigation of slow and medium speed aircraft. As the name implies, these charts are used in congested terminal areas since they provide greater detail and clarity of information. The scale is 1 inch equals 3.43 nautical miles or 4 statute miles.

Printed on the back of the terminal area chart is the VFR flyway planning chart.  It identifies flight paths clear of major controlled traffic flows.
Some terminal area charts feature "VFR waypoints," marked with a 4-point star.

VFR waypoints have a non-pronounceable 5-letter name beginning with V-P, and their location is pre-programmed into most GPS navigators. Most VFR waypoints are co-located with "visual check points," marked with a magenta flag.

Visual check points can be used to identify your position to A-T-C.  However, the 5-letter VFR waypoint identifier should not be used in communications with air traffic control.

The chart type most frequently used in private pilot training is the Sectional.  It's also the chart type used on the F-A-A private pilot knowledge tests.  The Sectional chart name is shown at the top, Cincinnati in this example.

Effective dates are found below the chart name.  The names and coverage area of all Sectional charts available for the United States are shown on the map.  Cincinnati is shaded to show this is a Cincinnati Sectional.The magenta boxes mark locations covered by a terminal area chart.  Notice the north/south arrows at the top.

Opening the chart in the direction of the north arrow shows the northern half of the area covered by the Sectional chart.

Looking at the other arrow, you'll see that the word south is printed upside down.  When the chart is opened in this direction it's upside down as well. Upon turning the chart upright, you'll find the southern half of the area covered by the Sectional chart.

Before we go any further you must understand how the world is divided for navigation purposes. An imaginary line called the equator divides the world into two equal parts, the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. From the equator to the North Pole is an angular distance of 90 degrees. At each 1 degree increment on this arc there are imaginary lines running parallel to the equator. They are called parallels or lines of latitude.  These parallels of latitude are used to describe navigational positions on the earth. The regulation writers like to call the lower 48 states the contiguous or conterminous states.

To avoid confusion, we'll also use the language of the regulations. The conterminous 48 united states lie between 25 degrees and 49 degrees north latitude. A position of 39 degrees north latitude would be located somewhere on a line 39 degrees north of and parallel to the equator.

Lines of longitude, known as meridians, cross the equator at right, 90 degree angles.  Each meridian is drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole, these lines are used to determine positions east and west on the earth.

The starting point, zero longitude, is called the prime meridian.  By international agreement, this line passes through Greenwich, England.  The prime meridian and the 180 degree longitude line halve the earth vertically.

Longitudes on the eastern half are said to be "east longitudes" and vice-versa for the west. The lower 48 states lie between 67 and 125 degrees west longitude.

A position of 77 degrees west longitude would be somewhere on a line 77 degrees west of the prime meridian. If we find a position of 39 degrees north latitude and 77 degrees west longitude, we'll locate Washington D.C.

From this example you can see a specific position on the earth's surface can be located by reference to its latitude and longitude. Traditionally, latitude is always given first followed by longitude.

On Sectional charts, the degree lines of latitude and longitude are shown and are further sub-divided by "tick" marks.  Each tick mark equals 1 minute. There are 60 minutes in each degree.

Let's use latitude and longitude to find Clermont County airport on the Cincinnati Sectional. Refer to the East Central Chart Supplement and in the Ohio section locate the information for the airport.

It's located at 39 degrees, 4.7-0 minutes north latitude, and 84 degrees, 12.6-2 minutes west longitude.  For practical purposes you don't have to use the fractions of a minute to find the airport.

Here is the 39th degree of latitude and here is the 84th degree of longitude.  The tick marks now come into use.  Notice to go north toward the 40th degree of latitude from the 39th degree of latitude you count up. So to go north 5 minutes count up four tick marks on the 84th longitude line. Don't forget to count tick marks that are obscured by map features.

To go west, move left thirteen minutes counting over 13 tick marks on the 39th degree line of latitude. Where the lines intersect you'll find Clermont County airport.  Don't let the lines on which you count confuse you.  As you can see, the way to measure distance between the 39th and 40th degree lines of latitude is by counting on a line of longitude.

Since each minute of latitude is a nautical mile, by counting the tick marks on the longitude scale, you can measure distance.

For example, you can determine the distance from Clermont County airport to Lunken airport by marking off the distance and measuring it against the tick marks of latitude on the longitude scale – it's 10 nautical miles. Measure it against the nautical scale on the bottom of the chart if you want to double check.

The only place where one minute of longitude equals one nautical mile is at the equator. This is because lines of longitude converge as they go north or south.  Even though the angular distance in degrees remains the same, the distance in miles decreases.  Because of this, distance can only be measured using lines of latitude.

Now that we've found Clermont County airport, let's take a look at airport symbols. On the Sectional chart legend, you'll see a number of airport symbols.  These are hard surfaced runways greater than 8,069 feet.  These symbols indicate runways 1500 to 8,069 feet in length.  This anchor indicates a seaplane base.  And circles alone designate airports with other than hard surfaced runways.

An "R" inside a circle indicates a private airport with non-public use but having emergency or landmark value. Airports with control towers are shown in blue along with their related information.  All other airports and related information are shown in magenta. Now that you're familiar with some basic airport symbols, let's now see what we can find out about Clermont County airport.

A magenta circle indicates a hard surfaced runway, while the open space within the circle shows the approximate runway orientation.  The runway is between 1500 to 8,069 feet in length and the airport has no control tower. Tick marks around the basic airport symbol indicate that fuel is available and the airport is attended during normal working hours.

We can find the actual length of Clermont County's runway by looking at the coded data provided along with the airport name. An airport's longest runway is always shown here in hundreds of feet.  Clermont County's runway is 3500 feet. The airport has an automated weather reporting station, which can be tuned in over the frequency of 127.275. The elevation of Clermont County is measured at the highest point on the useable portion of the landing area, which is 843 feet here. The "L" with a star means that there are runway lights, which are either pilot-controlled, part time, or available on request. An "L" without a star means the runway lights are left on from sunset to sunrise.

The final piece of information shown here is the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency, commonly referred to as the C-TAF, and is marked with the C in a solid circle. Clermont County uses a standard left-hand traffic pattern. If a right-hand traffic pattern is designated for a runway, the letters R-P, followed by the runway number, show this.

Let's take a look at a tower-controlled airport with multiple runways.  At Cincinnati Lunken airport, the longest runway is 6100 feet. The highest point on the landing runways is 483 feet, and the the tower frequency is 1-1-8.7.  A star following the tower frequency indicates a tower which operates part time.  Hours of tower operation can be found in the Sectional chart legend or in the Airport/ Facility Directory. The star at the top of the circle indicates an airport’s rotating beacon. This rotating beacon is in operation from sunset to sunrise and uses alternate white and green flashes.

A great deal of attention is given to showing the earth’s surface elevation and obstruction data on aeronautical charts. Contour lines are lines connecting points on the earth of equal elevation above mean sea level. On Sectional charts, basic contour lines are spaced at 500-foot intervals. The pattern of these lines and their spacing will give you a visual concept of the terrain. Widely spaced contours represent gentle slopes, while closely spaced contours represent steep slopes. Color tints are used to show bands of elevation.  These colors range from light green for the lower elevations, to brown for the higher elevations.

Generally, obstruction symbols are used to show man-made vertical features that extend more than 200 feet above the ground. Examples of features considered to be obstacles to low level flight are antennas, smoke stacks, and elevated cables, or pipelines crossing rivers or valleys. This symbol is used to show obstacles less than 999 feet above ground level.

And this symbol is used to show obstacles 1,000 feet or more above ground level. When known, the elevation of the top of the obstacle above sea level is shown. Additionally, the height above ground level is shown in parentheses just below the elevation. Groups of obstacles are shown using this symbol. Obstacles under construction are indicated by the letters U-C next to the symbol. Obstacles with high-intensity lighting are shown as this. And wind turbines look like this symbol. When numerous wind turbines are grouped together in a wind turbine farm, they are depicted like this.

Maximum elevation figures are shown on the chart in quadrangles bounded by ticked lines of longitude and latitude and are represented in thousands and hundreds of feet above mean sea level. The maximum elevation figures are calculated to be slightly higher than the highest known feature in each quadrangle.

Now we'll draw a line from Clermont County airport to the Fayette County airport, over to the Richmond airport, and then back to Clermont County.  Let's take a look at some of the symbols along this route.

Departing on course from Clermont County runway 4 would take you right over a major highway and an obstruction that is below 1,000 feet A-G-L.

Next you'll cross over a road and the small town of Owensville with a racetrack on the left. A power line, with lakes on the right and left, is next. Cross the power line, road, railroad, and you'll reach the small town of Martinsville. Airborne Airpark is now off to the left. The town of Sabina is on the left with a major road that leads right to Washington Courthouse. Fayette County airport is just northeast of the town of Washington Courthouse. Departing Fayette County airport for Richmond airport, we will cross a railroad, road, and then Interstate 71 as indicated by the shield shown here. Another four lane road, railroad, and xenia airport are next passed.  Notice the magenta flag at the town of Xenia, denoting a visual check point you can use to advise A-T-C on your initial contact of your position if necessary.

Note the bold 1-7 shown here.  This is the maximum elevation figure, or M-E-F, as described earlier, for this quadrangle. Back on course, cross over a four lane highway, two groups of obstructions, and another four lane highway, and you see Moraine Airpark. Two restricted or private airports shown for their emergency and landmark value are next. They’re followed by an obstruction and a city with a race track.

Another obstruction and a road lead to Richmond airport, which has the symbol for parachuting activity. Departing Richmond airport for Clermont County, there is a road off to the right and roughly parallel to the course that goes over to Hamilton -Fairfield airport. About halfway to Hamilton-Fairfield airport, a lake with a dam is shown.

Just south of Somerville, a lighted obstruction 1903 feet above mean sea level and 1,003 feet above the ground is depicted. Then cross a four lane highway, an obstruction, one last four lane highway, and here's Clermont County airport.

As you can see from this short trip, reading the symbols on the Sectional chart is not difficult.

Every day the earth turns one rotation of 360 degrees. Since one rotation is completed every 24 hours, the earth rotates at 15 degrees per hour.  Just as distance is measured in degrees east or west starting at the prime meridian in Greenwich, England, Greenwich is also used as the starting point in time calculations.

In most nations, the practice is to establish a time "zone" for each 15 degrees of longitude making a difference of one hour between each time zone. The conterminous United States is geographically located approximately between the 67th degree and 125th degree of longitude.

Since each 15 degrees of longitude equals one hour, the lower 48 states have four time zones, eastern, central, mountain, and pacific.

For example, when the sun is directly above the 90th degree of longitude, it is noon central standard time. At the same time it's 1 p.m. Eastern standard time, 11 a.m. Mountain standard time, and 10 a.m. Pacific standard time.

Aviation uses a 24 hour clock to avoid mistakes which could occur from failure to specify a.m. or p.m. You might have heard of the 24 hour clock being referred to as military time.
Basically, it works like this. The p.m. times simply continue to count up after twelve o'clock with one o'clock p.m. being one three zero zero.  Two o'clock is one four zero zero.  Three o'clock is one five zero zero.  You would refer to three thirty p.m. as one five three zero and so on, up to twelve o'clock a.m., which is zero zero zero zero. One o'clock a.m. is zero one zero zero, two o'clock is zero two zero zero and so on.

The standard for time keeping in aviation is the time in Greenwich, England.  This time is known as "coordinated universal time" or U-T-C.  The old term "Greenwich Mean Time" was replaced several years ago but some long-time pilots still use this term or G-M-T.  You will also hear U-T-C referred to as "ZULU" time.  So if you wish to convert from local time here in the U.S. to coordinated universal time or zulu time, you add hours as shown in this table.

For an example, if you depart at 10:30 central standard time for a 2 hour flight to an airport in the mountain standard time zone, what will the time be when you land? The first step to find your landing time would be to convert from central to coordinated universal time. Looking at the time conversion table, you would need to add 6 hours.  This gives you U-T-C or zulu time. Factor in your 2 hours for flight time and you'll see that your arrival time will be 18-30 U-T-C or zulu. The last step would then be to convert back from U-T-C to local mountain standard time. Remember, to convert from U-T-C to local time, you subtract. In this case, 7 is subtracted.  This gives an arrival time of 11:30 mountain standard time.

Like everything else in "aviation-speak", the more you do it, the easier it becomes.  You can probably expect a question or two on the knowledge portion of your test on time conversions, but if you remember what we've just discussed, they'll be easy.






































4. Air Facts: Where Is It Really
Every pilot has, at times, gotten a little bit confused while trying to locate a fix or identify an airport. Fixation and our tendency to see what we want to see can contribute to this mistaken identity.  
 
On a day VFR flight, you might see a town, decide it's one of your checkpoints, and head for it only to find you’re off course.  

And even airliners flown by two-person, professional crews have landed at the wrong airport.  
 
It usually occurred at night, when an inbound airline pilot spotted the lights of an airport, decided it was the one, and then focused on the arrival to that airport at the expense of the other clues. It’s likely that such mishaps occur in general aviation on a routine basis, but thankfully, usually only the pilot would ever know.
 
To avoid mistaken identity, the first rule of thumb is to use all of the information on your chart.  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words and a sectional or terminal area chart offers a wealth of information about airport features and surrounding terrain. 
 
Put your moving maps and other resources to use.  Many of us are flying regularly with GPS, color moving maps, iPads or other EFBs with the ability to overlay your aircraft’s position directly on chart. 
 
If you do not have this capability on the flight deck, access the many resources online including satellite imagery and airport diagrams to help visualize what you should be seeing in the immediate airport vicinity. 
 
Utilize the runway information at your intended airport as a final check.  In addition to the aircraft’s checklist, consider developing your own mental checks such as an “in-range” check and final approach check. 

As part of these mental checks, include verification of runway alignment and verify that runway numbers, the aircraft’s heading and the anticipated airport layout all make sense. 

If in doubt, ask!  If the correct airport or checkpoint is in question, ask for help from ATC.  By the same token, don’t leave responsibility for positive identification to anyone else, including air traffic control.
 
Adhering to a sterile cockpit rule will bring focus and attention to your important tasks.  In the professional world, crew members are prohibited from discussion of anything non-flight related while below 10,000’.  

This can easily be modified for general aviation to be in effect at a certain distance from the destination airport below a specific altitude.  

It would also allow you to inform passengers ahead of time about the rule or policy so you’re not trying to think or talk over a chatty “back-seater”.
 
Finally, inadequate planning, or improper execution of the plan, can lead to confusion.  But rather than think of being "lost", just think in terms of being "temporarily misplaced".  

You're probably not as far from the original plan as you think and a logical exploration of all factors will usually get you headed in the right direction.

Like all aeronautical decisions, a body of evidence should be gathered to support your conclusions.  Never rely on a single source of information.




























  5. Flight Planning and Computations

In the section on aeronautical charts, we looked at symbols on the Cincinnati sectional. We covered an area from Clermont County airport to Fayette County airport, over to the Richmond, Indiana airport and back to Clermont County airport.

Now let's look at the navigation planning that's done on the ground for the same trip.  

This planning is one of the key elements of proper pre-flight preparation. We'll use pilotage, dead reckoning, and radio navigation on our trip.

The only thing pilotage involves, is looking out the airplane window and flying along the course by reference to pre-selected landmarks until reaching the destination.

"Dead reckoning", is calculating the effect of the wind direction and speed on the airplane so a compass heading, ground speed, time en route, and fuel required can be estimated.

To radio navigate, an instrument indication helps lead the pilot along the desired course. Using a plotter, which is a device for measuring distance and direction, determine the distance from Clermont County airport to Fayette County airport, along the course line.

Some plotters have a sectional scale on one side and a world aeronautical chart scale on the other, so take care to use the correct side.

Simply read off the nautical miles scale that its 47 nautical miles. From Fayette County airport to Richmond airport measures 66 nautical miles.

From Richmond airport to Clermont County airport is 50 nautical miles. The total mileage for the trip is 163 nautical miles.

The next step is to determine the direction to each airport for our trip. In the charts section we showed how meridians of longitude run north and south, and meet at the poles.

By using these same meridians, direction from one point to another can be determined in degrees, measured clockwise from true north. A course measured this way is called a "true course."

To determine the true course from Clermont County airport to Fayette County airport, lay the plotter on the course line drawn on the chart between the airports, with the center of the protractor on a meridian.

Measure the angle this line makes with a meridian.

Because the course is in an easterly direction, read the angle on the outer scale. In this case the true course is 51 degrees.

From Fayette County airport to Richmond airport is a westerly direction, so we use the inner scale. The true course measures 280 degrees.

From Richmond airport to Clermont County, the true course is 145 degrees. If a course line is long and crosses numerous meridians, measure the course on one of the meridians closest to the center of the course since meridians converge toward the poles.

Now that we have distance and true course, we must consider the wind direction, since it affects our heading.

Wind information received over the radio for takeoffs or landings is given as a magnetic direction.  

This is done to eliminate confusion between true and magnetic winds since runway headings are also magnetic.

All other wind information spoken or printed is given in true direction. While flying from point A to point B, if there is no correction in heading for wind not aligned with the course, the airplane will drift off the intended track.

The difference between heading and track is known as the drift angle. To offset this unwanted drift, turn the airplane slightly into the direction of the wind.  

The direction in which the airplane's nose is pointing will be different from the true course.  This is called a true heading.

The combined effect of the movement of the airplane and the movement of the air results in the desired ground track.

The angle formed between the heading and the course is called the wind correction angle, but there's more.

The speed of the wind also has to be considered.  Think of wind as simply an ocean of air moving over the earth's surface in a specific direction.

True airspeed, the rate at which the airplane moves through the air, is not affected by the motion of the air.  But, the motion of the air does affect the airplane’s ground speed.

If we're flying east in a Skyhawk at 110 knots true airspeed in calm air, the ground speed is going to match the true airspeed at 110 knots.

If the air begins to move from the west to the east at 15 knots, the true airspeed remains the same, but the ground speed increases by 15 knots, from 110 to 125 knots, due to the tailwind.

If we turn the airplane 180 degrees and head back west, the wind becomes a headwind. The true airspeed will not change, but the 15 knot headwind reduces the ground speed by 15 knots, from 110 knots to 95 knots.

If a turn to the south is made and no correction for wind is applied, the airplane at the end of one hour will be 110 nautical miles south from where the turn was made, and 15 nautical miles to the east because of the movement of the air.

In these examples, the true airspeed remained constant at 110 knots but the ground speed changed. That's because ground speed is a combination of the movement of the airplane with the movement of the air.  

Direction and speed of the wind are therefore of prime interest to a pilot.

Next we have to consider the magnetic compass, which is the instrument used to set direction.  It's a very reliable instrument, not dependent on any power source in the airplane to operate.

It's also the instrument you referred to when setting the gyro stabilized heading indicator. However, when planning a trip, you have to take into consideration two factors which affect magnetic compass indications.

These are, magnetic variation and compass deviation.

By definition, variation is the angle between true north and magnetic north at any given location. The magnetic north pole is actually located in Canada more than 1,000 miles from the true North Pole.

On sectional and world aeronautical charts, the amount and direction of variation, which change from time to time, are shown by means of broken magenta lines called isogonic lines.  These connect points of equal variation.

The line that connects points at which there is zero variation between true north and magnetic north is called the agonic line.

What this means is that on the east coast the magnetic compass needle will point to the west of true north.

On the west coast the needle will point to the east of true north. Roughly, on a line through the western Great Lakes into the Gulf of Mexico, true and magnetic north coincide.

Since courses are measured on meridians pointing to true north, but flown using a magnetic compass that points to magnetic north, a method of converting from true to magnetic direction is used.

This conversion is done by adding or subtracting variation as shown by the nearest isogonic line on the chart.

For the next illustrations, assume there is a no-wind condition. To fly a true course of 51 degrees from Clermont County to Fayette County airport, check the nearest isogonic line – it's 6 degrees west.

This amount is added to 51 degrees to obtain a magnetic course of 57 degrees. Let's look at another example.  Assume that we are in the Los Angeles area, where the variation is 13 degrees east.

To fly a true north course of 360 degrees in this area, you must subtract 13 degrees and fly a magnetic course of 347 degrees.

A good way to remember if you add or subtract variation is by using the verse, "East is least and west is best, the rule is true when you start from true."

What this means is if the variation is east it's least so you subtract.  If it's west it's best so you add.  

This is valid as long as the conversion is from a true course to a magnetic course. The other factor affecting magnetic compass indications is deviation.

Deviation is the deflection of the magnetic compass from its normal reading caused by some magnetic influence in the airplane itself.

Every airplane must have a compass correction card.  The card is filled out by the manufacturer when the airplane is new.

It's revised by an authorized person whenever work is done on the airplane that may affect the compass – such as, when new radios are installed.

The compass card is usually mounted close to the compass, and shows any addition or subtraction necessary to correct for various headings. The corrections are usually shown at 30 degree intervals.

60 degrees is closest to our course of 51 degrees, so we'll subtract 2 degrees from our magnetic heading to get our compass heading.

A compass heading is the reading that's followed to achieve the desired course. A good way to remember the steps to determine compass heading is by using the verse, "TV makes dull children."

What this means is that after measuring true course and applying the wind correction, a true heading can be determined.

Next, apply variation to get the magnetic heading. Finally, correct for deviation and you arrive at a compass heading.

The best way to keep a record of all these calculations is by using a flight log.  There's one included on most flight plan forms.

In addition to distance and calculating the compass heading, we also want to determine the estimated time en route, ground speed, and how much fuel will be required. All these calculations can be done using either pencil and paper, or a flight computer, of which there are two types.  

There’s the old mechanical E6B which is just a circular slide rule. Most pilots today though are using the electronic type, which is more accurate and intuitive to use.

We will also need the pilot's operating handbook for our specific airplane since it's the only source of some additional information we need for our calculations.

This calculator expresses all airspeed problems with temperature in Celsius, altitude in feet, speed in knots, and distance in nautical miles.

These are the units most often used in aviation. The weather briefing forecasts winds at 3,000 feet to be from 340 degrees at 9 knots.  

The wind at 6,000 feet is 340 degrees at 11 knots with a temperature of minus 5 degrees Celsius. Using interpolation, we can expect the wind at 3,500 feet to be around 340 degrees at 9.3 knots.  We will round this to 9 knots.

The temperature is 6 degrees Celsius on the ground at Clermont County airport.

Therefore, using the standard lapse rate of 2 degrees C per thousand feet, we can estimate the temperature at 3,500 feet to be just under 1 degree Celsius.

We will use 1 degree.  On the trip, we'll plan to fly at 3,500 and 4,500 feet depending on our direction of travel.

We'll navigate the first leg from Clermont County airport to Fayette County airport using dead reckoning and pilotage, and fly at an altitude of 3,500 feet.

To calculate the dead reckoning information for this leg, we need first to determine true airspeed.

Use the graphs or tables in the performance section of your pilot's operating handbook to do this.

Select the cruise performance that best fits your needs.

On the first leg we will use a true airspeed of 115 knots.  We'll double check all the true airspeed figures once we are in the air.

The next step is to select heading and ground speed. Put in the wind direction of 340 degrees.  Now enter the wind speed at 9 knots and the true course of 51 degrees.

Enter the true airspeed of 100 knots, and the answer for ground speed is 96.7 knots with a heading of 46 degrees.  We'll round the groundspeed to 97 knots.

The 46 degree heading is only corrected for the wind.  We still have to add 6 degrees west variation, which we get off the sectional chart, and subtract 2 degrees for deviation from the compass correction card in the airplane. 

Our compass heading is 50 degrees. This is the direction we'll follow on the compass as we start our flight. Now, let's figure the time required to fly the first leg.

Select "leg time," press enter, and follow the prompts.  Flight time will be 25 minutes and 14 seconds - figure it at 25 minutes.

The next two legs will require 60 minutes of flight time, so the total flight time for all the legs is 1 hour and 25 minutes.

Since we will be landing at each airport, let's figure an additional 5 minutes will be needed for each leg to cover climb to altitude, descent, pattern, and taxi time.  This raises the total time to 1 hour 40 minutes.

Remember also, federal aviation regulations require that day VFR flights must have enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and, assuming normal cruising speed, to fly after that for at least 30 minutes.

To cover this fuel requirement, add 30 minutes to the 1 hour and 40 minutes trip time to get a total time of 2 hours and 10 minutes. Now let's figure the total fuel required for the trip.

Select "fuel required" and press enter. As prompted, enter time required at 2 hours and 10 minutes and press enter again. Find the fuel burn rate in the pilot's operating handbook.

Enter the rate of 9 gallons an hour for the Skyhawk. The amount of fuel required for the trip plus reserve will be 19.5 gallons.

It’s worth pointing out that for the purposes of this demonstration, we’ve used the regulatory fuel reserve requirement for VFR flight of 30 minutes. As with most regulatory requirements, this is an absolute minimum and not necessarily a practical fuel reserve. 

When calculating required fuel reserves, you always want to error on the conservative side. Slight delays such as a longer taxi, longer climb to your en-route altitude, or slight deviations from your desired course can quickly erode the minimum fuel reserves.

A good rule of thumb for any flight would be to factor in an hour’s worth of fuel reserve.

Since the Skyhawk holds 53 usable gallons, having enough fuel using either method presents no problem.

Also, a check of the Airport/Facility Directory shows fuel is available at our destination airports if more is needed for any reason. Since we will be navigating the first leg using pilotage, let's select a few checkpoints.

We will use the town of Owensville and the race track since they are close to the Clermont County airport. This will help us get started in the right direction.

The next checkpoint will be the town of Midland, a road, and a railroad. This will put us about 20 nautical miles from Clermont County airport. Next up will be Airborne Airpark on the left.

Now we are 28 nautical miles from Clermont County airport and have approximately 17 nautical miles left to go.

Next, we should see the town of Sabina off on the left, and the town of Washington Courthouse over the nose of the airplane.

The chart shows the airport is just north or above the town with a railroad track, road, and obstruction close by.

On this and all trips, take note of the airports along the route in case a diversion to one is required.

We'll also take along a St. Louis Sectional in case we need or want to go farther west into Indiana. We're planning on landing at Fayette County airport.

A check of the Airport/Facility Directory shows one runway, 5-23.  It's 5,097 feet long, 75 feet wide, and is paved with asphalt.  The CTAF is on 122.8.  

This is also the UNICOM frequency.  The field is attended from 13:00 to 23:00 Zulu Monday thru Saturday.  100 octane fuel is available.

On the second leg from Fayette County airport to Richmond airport, we'll use pilotage and dead reckoning, over to around Moraine Airpark.

From there we'll tune in the Richmond VOR on frequency 110.6, and use it to radio navigate to the Richmond airport.

We'll double check our position by getting a FROM reading on the Dayton VOR on frequency 114.5.

We'll back up the radio navigation with pilotage and dead reckoning. We'll also check our ground speed to see if our pre-flight computations for flight time and fuel are valid, or need to be updated.

On the third leg we'll radio navigate from the VOR located on the Richmond airport to the Hamilton area, and then tune in the non-directional radio beacon at Clermont County airport on frequency 245 to guide us to the airport.  

Again, we'll back up the radio navigation with pilotage and dead reckoning. On this cross-country plan, you've seen how long trips are nothing more than a series of short trip legs strung together.

Even as airliners span the globe, they do it the same way – from point to point.  Granted, their equipment is more sophisticated, but the principle’s the same.  Later in this volume, we'll actually fly this trip.































6. Cross-Country Flight Planning with iPad

During your flight training you will learn to plan cross-country flights using multiple techniques. You’ll likely start by planning a trip with a paper sectional chart, plotter and E6B, and complete a paper navigation log with all the details of the flight. 

You’ll find this exercise worthwhile to help understand both the purpose and logic behind each calculation.

Another method is to use an electronic resource, like ForeFlight on an iPad, to assist with the planning process. 

This method is much more convenient, delivers more accurate results, and is faster as long as you begin with accurate performance information 

To show you how this method works, we’re going to plan a flight from Lunken Airport, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Charleston, West Virginia using ForeFlight. 

For training purposes, we will still pick visual checkpoints along the route, the same way as if we were using a paper sectional, and use pilotage and dead reckoning as the primary means of navigation for the flight.

The first step is to create an aircraft profile in your app and enter the basic information about your airplane. In ForeFlight, this is accomplished from the Aircraft section of the app. 

There are lots of customization options here, but for now you just need to enter the N# and aircraft type - the other fields are used for VFR flight plans and weight and balance functions and can be revisited later if needed.

Tap the Performance Profile button to enter climb, cruise and descent performance data for your airplane. Use Climb performance data from your airplane’s flight manual to find the numbers for the climb section, and the Cruise Performance chart to determine True Airspeed and the fuel burn rate. 

Remember, these performance numbers will be different for each flight, depending on the conditions of the day and selected cruise altitude, so you’ll need to update this for each flight with the data from your airplane’s performance charts.

If you have an upgraded ForeFlight subscription, you’ll have access to ForeFlight Performance Profiles, which include detailed performance data for most training airplanes. 

These incorporate all the airplane’s performance numbers from the flight manual to accurately compute climb, cruise and descent performance data based on the selected cruise altitude current and current weather.

But a word of caution, be sure you’re selecting the airplane profile that matches your airplane model exactly. For example, performance profiles for different model Cessna Skyhawks or Piper Cherokees can vary significantly.

Next, head over to the Maps page and open the Route Editor window at the top of the screen. Tap anywhere in the middle of the route editor to enter the departure and destination airport, and ForeFlight will draw a magenta line on the map between the two airports. 

Tap the time button at the lower right to enter your planned departure time, which will ensure ForeFlight uses the correct winds aloft forecast when computing the navlog. It’s important to verify you’re connected to the internet over WiFi or LTE during this step, to ensure the app is using current weather data.

Tap the airplane button at the top left of the route editor and select your new aircraft profile. If you need to modify the cruise true airspeed or fuel burn for varying conditions, tap the profile button and update the climb, cruise and descent performance as necessary.

Next, make sure VFR is selected at the bottom and that the correct direction of flight is selected, so that the correct altitude options are displayed.

After selecting an altitude, you’ll see the key performance numbers at the bottom of the route editor: trip distance, estimated time en route, estimated time of arrival, fuel burn and the net headwind or tailwind for the flight.

Since we’ll be flying the trip using the same pilotage and dead reckoning skills as if we had a paper sectional chart in hand, we’ll next select visual landmarks every ten to fifteen miles on the chart to serve as visual checkpoints along the way.

Place two fingers on the chart on the map to activate the ruler to find the first landmark - in this example we’ll use the north shore of this lake for the first checkpoint. 

Tap and hold on the line at that spot and tap the coordinates displayed to add a waypoint on the map. Continue this process until you have checkpoints established for the entire trip.

You can even name the waypoints if you’d like, by tapping on each point on the map, tap Save, and enter a new name at the top for the new user waypoint, and press save again. 

You’ll want to be careful when creating these new waypoints to ensure they remain on the direct course line between the departure and destination airport; otherwise you will have slight differences in the course heading between each leg.

You can also use the map annotations tool to draw the location of landmarks on the map.

Now that your trip is planned, it’s time to review the navlog in preparation for flying the trip. Tap the NavLog button at the lower right of the Route Editor to display navigation details for each leg between the selected checkpoints. 

It’s important to note that the Heading value displayed here is the magnetic heading to fly and includes adjustments for both the wind aloft and magnetic variation. 

You will need to adjust this though for magnetic deviation using the compass correction card in your airplane, to determine the final compass heading to fly in the airplane.

When it comes time to depart on the flight, you’ll want to disable the display of your location on the moving map in ForeFlight (often referred to as ownship). 

To do this, go to the main settings screen, scroll down to the Preferences section and disable the setting for “Enable Ownship”. 

This training technique will allow you to focus on flying the trip using the planned compass heading and by visual reference to landmarks on the ground, instead of GPS on a moving map. 

This will help you build valuable navigation skills, confidence, and keep your eyes out the windows -- you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy the benefits of flying with GPS in ForeFlight after the checkride.


























7. Air Facts: Leave Yourself an Out
Planning a flight carefully can help avoid surprises and surprises are something that we really want to avoid in flying. But everything can't always go exactly according to plan, we all know that. 

So, if we put a little bit of effort in our flight planning into examining contingencies and alternate plans, we can save ourselves a lot of trouble later on if something goes awry.

It is helpful to review those options before the flight to look at alternate airports -- places to land along the way should the need arise. 

You’ll have to establish some basic criteria as a first step. Some things to consider would be runway length and width, surface conditions and even services available at the airport as a start.

We might plot a line on the chart from here to there, but instead of thinking of it as a line when we study the chart, it's better to think of it as, say, a 20 or 30 mile wide band. 

 What might terrain or obstruction considerations be if you stray off course. What is the most likely direction for better weather. Don’t forget that the best alternate may even be behind you.

We want to have a general understanding of obstructions, terrain, airports, landmarks and any type of airspace restrictions or potential weather hazards located within this swatch, all the way from here to there. 

One vital element of contingency planning relates to fuel. The leading cause of engine failures is, you guessed it, fuel exhaustion, or running out of gas. 

It has happened in airline aircraft, military aircraft, and general aviation aircraft. The only way never, ever to be exposed to the hazard of fuel exhaustion is to plan very conservatively and be sure of the amount of fuel you’re starting with or even the most conservative plan may not be enough.

Some say that the only time you can have too much fuel in an airplane is when it’s on fire. Perhaps that is taking it a bit far, but do plan to land with at least an hour’s worth of fuel in the tank. 

The law requires less, 30 minutes by day and 45 by night, but what's legal is not always safe. Also, when calculating the amount of fuel that will be required to fly the leg, a good rule of thumb is to double the forecast headwind component or halve the tailwind component for the purpose of fuel planning. 

That way, if the forecast is incorrect, you are less likely to be surprised. Another conservative practice is to always round up when it comes to fuel burn. 




































































8. VOR Navigation
There are several types of air navigation systems in use today, each serving specialized purposes. Navigation systems include any method a pilot uses to follow a predetermined flight path over the earth's surface. 

A navigation system may be totally aircraft based, such as an inertial navigation system, which does not require outside visual, radio, or radar contact. 

Or it can be entirely ground based, with ground radar continuously monitoring the position of the aircraft, and navigational guidance given to the pilot over the radio. 

The most common system uses a combination of ground and airborne equipment. Ground equipment transmits signals to airborne receivers, and pilots then determine and control ground track on the basis of instrument indications. 

The very high frequency OMNI-directional range is abbreviated VOR.
Military and naval aviation uses a comparable system which transmits on ultra high frequency called tactical air navigation, or TACAN. 

Most VOR sites also have an operating TACAN. The combination of the stations is called a VORTAC. A VORTAC has two distinctly different transmitters and antenna systems at the same site. 

For now, our discussion will deal only with the VOR, and we'll refer to both VOR's and VORTACs as VOR's. 

The VOR station is easily spotted from the air. It is a small low building topped with a flat white disc which houses an antenna system. 

This is the sectional chart symbol for a VOR. Here is the symbol for a VORTAC. The frequency for the VOR is shown in a box near the station symbol. Sectional charts do not show TACANs. 

A compass rose is centered on the VOR symbol. The compass rose and the VOR are aligned with magnetic north. Everything else on the sectional chart is oriented with true north. In sections of the country where there is considerable magnetic variation, the compass rose appears to be tilted. 

Pilots can select 360 different courses when navigating with reference to a VOR. Courses emanating from a VOR are called "radials". Radials are defined as magnetic courses from a VOR. This is the 360 degree radial extending north from the VOR, and this is the 180 degree radial extending south from the station. 

To keep your semantics straight, radials are the "spokes" which radiate FROM a VOR, and bearings are the "courses" flown either TO or FROM a VOR. 

For that matter, bearings and courses are the direction flown to or from any point on the surface. The Airport/Facility Directory Chart Supplement will show unusable radials of a VORTAC, such as the Helena VORTAC in Montana. 

The 035 degree through the 050 degree radials are unusable below 12,000 feet, beyond 35 nautical miles, among others. 

VOR signal reception is line of sight and varies according to the altitude of your airplane. Obstructions, or the curvature of the earth in the direct line between the airplane and transmitting station, will block out VHF signal reception. 

At 1,000 feet above the altitude of the transmitting station, normal reception extends to 40 nautical miles from the station. 

The reception range is proportionally less at lower altitudes. VOR's are identified by a three letter Morse code shown on charts. 

If a VOR is transmitting while undergoing maintenance, the station will either transmit the Morse letters t-e-s-t, or remove the identifier altogether. 

This is done to inform you that the VOR signal may be inaccurate or unreliable, and the station should not be used. Listening to the signal, to identify the station, is extremely important. 

First, be sure the correct station is tuned in and, second, be certain the station is operating normally. 

The accuracy of the VOR system depends on proper adjustment of both the transmitter and the receiving equipment. 

With the transmitter and receiver operating normally, accuracy is generally plus or minus one degree. 

The VOR receiver has a volume control, ident switch, and frequency selector. Frequencies for VOR's range from 108 to 117.95 megahertz. 

Pulling the ident switch allows you to hear the Morse code identification, along with any voice transmissions over the VOR. 

With the switch pushed in, the Morse tones are suppressed, making it easier to hear voice transmissions. 

The VOR indicator has an Omni Bearing Selector, abbreviated OBS, a course deviation indicator, a CDI for short, and a TO/FROM indicator. There are a couple of ways to show that no signal is being received or that the signal is too weak. 

Some indicators show an "OFF" flag. Others just do not show a TO or FROM indication. As the name implies, the omni bearing selector is used to select the bearing, or course. When a course is selected, the course deviation indicator shows the position of the selected course. 

The indications of the CDI and the TO/FROM indicator are not affected by the heading of the airplane. At any location, if the CDI indicates the selected course is to the left, the CDI will always be to the left no matter which way the airplane is pointed. 

Because you will see the same indication on all headings, the left and right information is only valid when the airplane is pointed in the same direction as the selected course. The left and right CDI indications will be correct if the airplane heading generally agrees with the course selected on the OBS. 

Think of the airplane as the center dot and the needle as the selected course. If the needle is centered, the airplane is on the selected course. 

If the CDI is pointed to the right, the selected course is to the right of the airplane. A needle to the left means the course is to the left. 

A full scale deflection of the CDI represents 10 degrees. Because this information is angular, the actual distance off course depends on the distance from the station. A half scale, or 5 degree deviation, 10 miles from the station puts you about a mile off course. 

Thirty miles from the station, the same deviation puts you about 3 miles off course. The TO/FROM indicator shows whether the selected course will take the airplane to, or from the station. 

Some manuals call the TO/FROM indicator the ambiguity meter, so named because it resolves the ambiguity of whether the selected course will take the airplane TO or FROM the station. From the north on the 360 degree radial, a bearing of 180 degrees "TO" will take the airplane on a course to the station. 

The same course from the south will take the airplane from the station. The TO/FROM indicator measures the radials that are at right angles to the course set on the OBS. 

When crossing those radials, the TO/FROM indicator will flip, even if the airplane is miles away from the station. 

Remember, VOR indications are not changed by the heading of the airplane. 
In all three airplanes, with the OBS set to 180 degrees, the CDI is centered with a "FROM" indication. 

Turn the OBS to 360 degrees, and the CDI will again be centered with a "TO" indication. The heading of the airplane only affects how long the CDI will remain centered. If the airplanes continue on these headings, the CDI will not stay centered. 

Orientation is a word you'll hear a lot. The dictionary defines it as determining ones position. If you have to determine your position, you probably aren't lost, but merely not sure of your exact position. 

As an example, flying from the Clark airport to the Mineral Wells airport using the VOR to locate yourself is fairly easy if you follow some simple steps. 

First, tune the VOR receiver to a nearby VOR. Remember you aren't really lost. You know that you are in a certain area. 

After you have identified the station, turn the OBS to center the CDI. Don't rush this. Spinning the OBS too fast will make the CDI move like a windshield wiper. When the CDI is centered, you have all the information you need. Read the course from the OBS, and TO or FROM on the TO/FROM indicator. 

If the OBS is on 194 degrees with a FROM indication, you can draw a line from the Millsap VOR on the 194 degrees radial, and know that you are located somewhere on that line. To fix your position on this line, you could look for a landmark, or find your position in relation to another VOR. 

The Glen Rose VOR is close to your line of position. Tune to the Glen Rose VOR, repeat the process, and the CDI centers on the 310 degree radial from the Glen Rose VOR. 
 
Your position is where the 310 degree radial from Glen Rose intersects the 194 degree radial from Millsap. To find a bearing to the Millsap VOR, tune in the VOR, set the OBS to center the CDI with a "TO" indication. 

The OBS is on 014 degrees, so turn the airplane to a heading of 014 degrees. As you fly inbound make heading changes to keep the CDI centered. 

As you get closer to the station, the heading corrections needed will be smaller. This is because radials are like the spokes of a wheel, they converge at the station. 

Within a few miles of the station you'll notice the CDI and the TO/FROM indicator flickering. The size of this "cone of confusion" is relatively small at low altitudes and increases with altitude. Do not mistake this cone of confusion for station passage. 

Station passage is indicated when the TO/FROM indicator makes the first complete reversal to a FROM indication. 

The Mineral Wells airport is on the 307 degree radial and 4.6 nautical miles from the Millsap VOR. 
After crossing the VOR, change the OBS to 307 degrees, and turn the airplane to 307 degrees. 

Then make small corrections as needed to keep the CDI centered. Use small corrections because the airplane is very close to the VOR. You might encounter some minor course roughness on VOR's. Some receivers are more susceptible to this than others. 

Course roughness can be caused by rough terrain and appears as CDI or TO/FROM indicator fluctuations. 

Like the VOR, TACAN provides line of sight information transmitted on ultra high frequencies. Receiving equipment for the TACAN course, also called the azimuth feature, is generally not available for civilian aircraft. 

TACAN has another feature which is a distance measuring capability. Equipment to use this feature is available and installed in many civilian aircraft. 

Distance measuring equipment, DME, does away with the need for a cross fix from another VOR to establish the aircraft's position. 

The pilot selects the frequency of the VORTAC on the DME. The airborne DME sends a signal which triggers a response from the ground station. The airborne equipment measures the time the round trip signal took, and presents the information as nautical miles. 

Some DMEs also show ground speed and time to the station. 

Some VORs only have the DME feature of the TACAN. These are called VOR-DMEs, and are shown on charts by the VOR hexagon symbol inside a square. 

Although VOR-DMEs aren't equipped for TACAN use by the military, civilian pilots can get distance from the station if their airplane is equipped with distance measuring equipment. 

A VOR receiver used under instrument flight rules must have been operationally checked for accuracy within the past 30 days. While this check is not required for VFR, it is certainly a good operating practice. 

There are several ways to check the accuracy of the VOR receiver. The Airport/Facility Directory Chart Supplement lists designated ground and airborne receiver checkpoints. 

At these locations, a specified radial should be received. Allowable error for VFR is not prescribed. 

For IFR, the ground check error cannot exceed 4 degrees. Maximum error using the designated airborne check is 6 degrees. 

Another way to check the VOR is the very high frequency omni test, or VOT. VOTs provide a convenient means of determining the accuracy of a VOR receiver while the airplane is on the airport where a VOT is located. 

Use of VOTs while airborne is strictly limited to those areas and altitudes specified in the Airport/Facility Directory Chart Supplement. 

VOTs are identified by either a continuous tone or a series of dots. VOTs transmit the 360 degree radial in all directions. No matter where the aircraft is located, the VOR receiver will indicate the 360 degree radial. 

Electronically, the aircraft is always located north of the VOT. There is no prescribed accuracy requirement for VFR use. 

For IFR, the CDI must center within 4 degrees of 360 degrees FROM, or 180 degrees TO. 

It's recommended that VOR receivers be recalibrated annually. Radio repair shops have a test signal generator similar to the VOT which is used to calibrate VOR receivers. 

As mentioned earlier, don't think of yourself as lost, just temporarily misplaced. With the help nearby VORs, you can easily pinpoint your position.

If you’re making exacting fuel burn calculations down to the tenth of a gallon, consider rounding up to the next highest gallon and consider the leaning technique that was used to arrive at the published fuel burn. 

So, plan those flights so that plan "A" is primary, backed up by plan "B", and plan "C", and plan "D", and however many it takes and have the discipline to enact a contingency plan should the need arise. 

It is fun to vicariously fly a flight, to study the chart, look at the airports, and landmarks along the way. 

Then, if when you start out on your solo cross-countries, something slightly out of the ordinary happens, you’ll have the confidence and experience to make a good decision.










































9. Global Positioning System (GPS)
GPS stands for Global Positioning System and it does just that - its signal is available anywhere on the earth 24/7. Pretty impressive. 

If you have a GPS receiver, you can determine your exact geographical position at any point on the globe - walking, riding, or flying.

A collection of space satellites make up the GPS Constellation and continually orbit the earth.

In general, a satellite sends a signal to your receiver. Your GPS unit uses this information and the information from other satellites, to compute your position. 

This calculation is based upon the differences between the times that the signals were sent and the times they were received.

For you the pilot, satellite based navigators will accurately locate your airplane position anywhere on or near the surface of the earth.

There are many benefits to GPS navigation. It enhances your safety through more accurate positioning than other methods. 

It improves your situational awareness by displaying exactly where you are on a moving map. It can save time, fuel, and therefore money by allowing simplified point to point navigation.

Today's aviation GPS receiver is a marvel of technology. It may provide airport frequencies and data, airspace descriptions, terrain warnings, winds aloft speed and direction, your ground speed and time to waypoint - the list goes on.

It's not as important to know all the details of how the GPS system as a whole works. It's much more important to understand how you can use your GPS receiver in your normal VFR flying.

When you first turn on your GPS receiver, it takes a little time for the unit to identify the necessary number of satellites in order to acquire your position. 

Basic GPS will provide horizontal guidance with an accuracy to around 12 meters. However, if your receiver is equipped with WAAS, the Wide Area Augmentation System, its accuracy will be greatly increased and will provide you with a position accuracy of less than 3 meters. 

WAAS does this by using information from additional satellites to correct minor fluctuations in the GPS signal.

GPS receivers come in a variety of forms: panel mounted, hand held units and on mobile tablets and phones. When flying with a mobile tablet, you may need to add a separate GPS antenna to get position information on your device. Most of the glass cockpit systems also incorporate GPS technology. 

All aviation GPS units are approved for VFR use, but not all are approved for use under instrument flight rules. You must consult the owner's manual or Flight Manual Supplement for more information on the unit's approved use.

Even the simplest of these units contain a wealth of information. So much so that you will need to take some study time to familiarize yourself with most of it. 

The time to do this is on the ground and not in the air. The most dangerous thing you can do is to fumble with your unit while flying rather than looking outside for other traffic.

Study your owner's manual. Some units have a simulation mode that can be used on the ground. If the manufacturer has computer based tutorial software get a copy and use it at your desk - it will save you a lot of money. Learning while flying is expensive and not as productive - too many distractions in the cockpit.

What can an aviation unit provide? How might you use it in VFR flying? Let's investigate that. Earlier we gave you a few ideas of what the GPS receiver will contain. What features do they have in common?

One of most useful features is the wealth of information stored in its database. It can tell you the nearest airports, what airspace you are approaching and, in some cases, alert you to TFRs and other restricted airspace. Many will also give you obstacle clearance data.

It will contain airports and other waypoints. Some units give you, besides runway headings, the length and width of the runways, airport taxiway maps, approach and departure information, and even runway centerlines.

Most units have a "Nearest" function. This function allows you to locate airports, navaids, or other waypoints in the database that are closest to your current position. This information can be invaluable in an emergency.

When flying, your GPS unit will provide you with ground speed, your distance to the next waypoint, your estimated time of arrival and your track and heading. For the most part, it does all this automatically.

Once you are familiar with your unit, it's time to fly. As a note, you should always make sure your database is current. This is not a requirement for VFR operations but a good safety practice.

It is not a good idea to use your GPS receiver as your only navigation source. Once you are completely familiar with it in various flight situations then utilize its full capacity as a companion navigational aid along with pilotage and dead reckoning.

The first thing you will want to do is load your flight plan into the system. If you are using a handheld unit, program your trip as part of your preflight planning or the night before the flight. 

If your unit is installed, don't try to load the flight plan while taxiing or in the air. Do it while you are parked. As before, it's too easy to fixate on the unit and not see and avoid.

Your flight plan, for the most part, will be point to point flying. In other words, you won't have to fly victor airways unless you want to. 

In entering your airports in the GPS receiver, you precede the airport identifier with a K, as in KLUK, if it is comprised of letters only. If it contains one or more numbers, omit the K, as in I69, and just enter India six niner.

You will fly the course line between waypoints. The unit may automatically compute wind speed and direction. 

Some units will require you to enter actual heading and true airspeed data in order to make these calculations.

If you are flying in the sequencing mode, you should set your course into the OBS as a reminder. Some units will give you an advisory to do this. 

In this mode of operation, changing the OBS setting, does not affect the operation of the CDI. If you are on the GPS course, the CDI will remain centered regardless of the OBS setting. 

Remember, you still need to work up a proper flight plan, just as you did when you didn't have a GPS unit. 

What if your system fails, the batteries die, how will you know where you are and where your destination is? You need to check your progress with good old fashioned pilotage and dead reckoning.

Another helpful feature of these units is the Direct-to function. Let's say you are unsure of your location or encounter some in-flight emergency. 

You can check for the nearest airport, enter it into the GPS receiver, and hit the Direct-to button. 

The unit will draw a course line from your position to the airport. Just intercept the course line and fly to your chosen waypoint.

Most GPS databases are organized in a kind of chapter and page setup. There is usually a satellite status page, a map page for visual navigation - on newer units it's much like looking at your sectional chart but your airplane's position is indicated on the chart by an icon- pages with airport information, intersections, NDBs, VORs, and possibly a user waypoint list. 

There is usually a section that covers trip planning information - a trip timer, a page where you can turn on or off various unit features and setup options.

With all this information at your fingertips it's easy to personalize your unit according to the way you fly. They are truly wonderful devices.

Just a few other points to consider. If your unit is a handheld or mobile tablet, you will want to have a battery backup or a power cord for it on board. 

Make sure you place the GPS antenna in a good spot that can "see" enough satellites for accuracy and won't slide around during your flight. 

GPS is a wonderful addition to your flying. It will enhance your safety, your situational awareness, and provide you with a vast amount of information. It does all this in one small, convenient package.




































10. Glass Cockpit Flight Instruments
Let's take a look at some of the flight instruments' similarities and differences. The most prominent instrument on the PFD is the attitude indicator. It's quite large, easy to interpret, and rather self explanatory - it does however have a few unique features not found on its analog gauge cousin.

If the pilot becomes too aggressive on the pitch, starting at 50 degrees above and 30 degrees below the horizon, red warning chevrons appear pointing in the direction of the horizon. This can be a big help if you become disoriented.

Also, if the aircraft's pitch exceeds plus 30 degrees or minus 20 degrees, or when the bank angle is sixty-five degrees or better, the PFD automatically de-clutters, turning off it's less important data displays. This helps focus your attention on the attitude indicator so you can more quickly correct the situation.

Notice that the entire PFD background, the earth, horizon, and sky, moves - the yellow airplane symbol remains stationary. 

The slip and skid indicator is a small horizontal line located under the triangle roll pointer. It is, at first, hard to recognize and its small size is sometimes a challenge for the newly initiated.  

It works the same however, as the standard inclinometer - step on the line instead of the ball. Underneath the attitude indicator is a large horizontal situation indicator.

The HSI displays a rotating compass card with the usual cardinal points, numeric labels, and tick marks. It also depicts information common to any other HSI. However, there are some differences.

Using the softkeys, the G1000 allows you to choose to view the HSI as a complete unit or as an arc. A large heading box is centered on top of the HSI - allowing for a direct digital readout of your heading. This makes selecting and holding a precise heading a piece of cake.

As on most HSI's, a rotatable heading bug operates on the compass rose and marks the desired heading. You can use it as a memory device or actually steer the airplane with it in conjunction with the autopilot.

There are two smaller boxes on either side of the HSI. The selected heading appears in a box left of the lubber line in light blue numerals. The selected course appears in a box to the right of the lubber line. 

It becomes a magenta color if the navigation source is the GPS, or green if the navigation source originates from the VOR or localizer receivers.

There is also a magenta diamond, the current track indicator, that appears on the outer rim of the HSI. This is basically an indication of your airplane's track across the ground, useful for staying on course en route with strong crosswinds. Simply fly the heading that puts the diamond on top of the CDI head.

Bearing pointers can be overlaid on the HSI to show bearings to additional nav sources using the PFD softkeys.

Another feature of the G1000 is a wide magenta line, called a trend vector. It displays the current turn rate up to 24 degrees per 6 seconds. A magenta arrowhead appears at 25 degrees. 

This trend vector indicates where the heading will be six seconds from now, at your present rate of turn. These vector lines are present in other flight instruments as well.

Notice that the turn rate indicator's tick marks are placed at 9 degrees and 18 degrees either side of the lubber line. Doing some quick math, 18 degrees in 6 seconds is 3 degrees per second; a standard rate turn. 

9 degrees in 6 seconds is a half standard rate turn. Set a bank angle to place the trend vector on the tick mark to obtain the desired rate of turn.

Just to the left of the attitude indicator and HSI is the airspeed indicator. Airspeed is depicted on a rolling vertical tape rather than a round dial.

Its speed ranges are depicted in the familiar colors of white, green, yellow, and red. The actual airspeed is displayed inside a black pointer.

What is different is the presence of a magenta airspeed trend vector. If the airspeed is constant, the trend vector isn't visible. As speed increases or decreases, the trend vector will indicate where the speed will be in six seconds if the present rate of change continues.

Another addition is that of v speed reference marks located adjacent to their respective speeds. A nice touch - you don't have to worry about forgetting or confusing a v speed. These speeds can be changed if desired. 

To adjust one of the v speeds, press the timer reference soft key at the lower corner of the pfd and use the fms knob to highlight one of the numbers and make a change. A star will appear next to the star to indicate that it has been modified from the default value.

If you exceed vne, a barber pole pattern appears above it and the black airspeed pointer turns red. Below the airspeed's vertical tape is a true airspeed box - the G1000 does a lot of the computations for you.

If you get too slow, a red range mark appears as a warning. The altimeter is located to the right of the attitude indicator. It's also depicted as a rolling vertical tape. 

Most pilots report that it's easier to read than a conventional altimeter - no three hands to interpret. 

You read the actual altitude in numeric fashion, which is depicted on a black pointer. Besides altitude, the device features a barometric pressure setting box under the tape - set it using either of the baro knobs. It also incorporates a selected altitude box positioned over the vertical tape.

An altitude reference bug is an added feature as well. Both the selected altitude box and bug are set by using the alt knob located on the left side of either the PFD's or MFD's bezel.

As on both the HSI and airspeed indicator, the altimeter features a trend vector. It works the same as the one for the airspeed indicator and HSI.

To the right and attached to the altimeter is the vertical speed indicator. It is shown as a non-moving vertical tape.

It is set up in the usual way with major tick marks at 1,000 and 2,000 feet per minute and minor tick marks at intervals of 500 feet per minute. 

You read the actual vertical speed on the vertical speed pointer - a numerical indication begins when your climb or descent is greater than plus or minus 100 feet per minute.

When using a vertical navigation feature, a magenta chevron is displayed on the MFD to indicate the required vertical speed for reaching a target altitude. 

This will appear when nearing the top of the descent---after the “TOD within 1 minute” alert has appeared.

The nav and com frequency windows are located on the top left and right side of both the PFD and MFD screens.

The active frequency appears on the innermost position of both. The standby frequency on the outermost position of both. An active com frequency will be colored green when it is selected on the audio panel.

A green nav frequency indicates that it is the source for the CDI on the HSI. A blue tuning box can be shuttled between nav1 and nav2 or com1 and com2 by pushing the inner nav or com knob respectively.

The desired frequency can be either dialed into the tuning box in the standard way, or can be located on various waypoint and nearest pages, highlighted, and entered automatically. This function will be discussed more completely, later.

When a navigation frequency has been entered, and the facility is in range, the G1000 will auto-identify the nav facility. This is indicated by both the frequency and its identifier turning green.

Located between the frequency windows is the navigation status bar. It provides valuable, current information about the flight - for example it will give you the next waypoint, the distance to the next waypoint, and the desired and current track. It also has an area dedicated to various messages. 

The transponder status bar is located in the right lower corner of the PFD.
When the airplane is on the ground it presents the abbreviation 'GND', when sufficient airspeed is sensed, the GND indication changes to ALT.

You operate it like a standalone transponder by using the appropriate softkeys. An inset information box can be added to the right lower side of the PFD. 

It shows alerts, nearest airports, a timer function, v-speed changes, your flight plan, or dme tuning. These can be activated by the appropriate softkeys and buttons.

A map inset box can be shown on the left lower portion of the PFD. This is an abbreviated version of your GPS position and associated flight information from the MFD.

Finally, on the extreme left corner of the PFD there is an outside air temperature box. The audio panel and marker beacon controls are located between the two screens. It's comprised of three major systems; communication, navigation, and intercom.

A digital recorder is incorporated into the system and will play back two and a half minutes of communication audio. Recording is automatic when a com signal is received. If you miss some part of a communication, press the play key for a repetition.

At the bottom of the unit is the red display backup button. It selects the reversionary mode. If a push-to-talk button becomes stuck, the communication transmitter stops transmitting after 35 seconds of continuous operation. An alert appears on the PFD indicating a stuck microphone.

As long as the push-to-talk button is stuck, either the com1 mic or com2 mic key annunciator on the audio panel flashes.

If the communication system fails, the emergency frequency, 121.5 mhz, is automatically tuned in and a red x may appear on the frequency display, depending on the type of failure. If the audio panel fails, a fail-safe circuit connects the pilot's headset and microphone directly to the com1 transceiver.

There may be one or two 3.5 mm audio inputs which will accommodate a portable music device or audio from a phone or tablet. When two inputs are installed, music input number one is routed to the pilots and has automatic muting functions. 

Music input number two is routed to the passengers and does not get muted. Sirius-xm radio entertainment is optional on the G1000.

Before getting into the airplane, let's look at some of the alerts and annunciations that you may encounter with the G1000.

The G1000 alerting system informs the pilot of vital information in a number of ways. There is an annunciation window positioned to the right of the altitude and vertical speed tapes. Twelve annunciations can be displayed at the same time.

There is also an alerts window that can be displayed on the lower right corner of the PFD. To activate this window, press the alerts softkey. 

Press it a second time to remove the window. To scroll through the list, use the large FMS knob. More on this knob later.

Occasionally, the alerts softkey may flash to get your attention. The words warning, caution, or advisory may appear. Press the softkey to acknowledge the alert.

If the G1000 detects a major failure in one of its systems, a large red 'x' appears on the affected system. 

In some circumstances, the G1000 will use an additional alert in the form of an audible tone or voice alert.

The G1000 uses three alert levels to get your attention. A warning requires immediate pilot attention - it's accompanied by a continuous audible tone, the warning appears in red, and the warning annunciator softkey flashes.

Caution indicates a situation that may require the pilot's intervention - it's accompanied by a single aural tone, the caution appears in yellow, and the caution annunciator softkey flashes.

Advisory is just that, it presents general information to the pilot. The advisory appears in white and the advisory annunciator softkey flashes.

The G1000 equipped airplane has many types of alerts - too many for this program to demonstrate. To get an idea of them check out your specific aircraft information manual.




































































11. Closer Look: Airport Services
As you take longer cross country trips and begin making use of your pilot certificate after the checkride, you will need fuel away from your home airport.  

Most airports have at least one fixed base operator – or FBO – that can sell you fuel.  Just as in your car on the road, you can look for the fuel company signs on the ramp or take advantage of the many websites or flight planning apps ahead of your flight that provide details about fuel providers and pricing. It’s always a good idea to check ahead of time to make sure fuel will be available when you arrive.

As you pull up to the FBO, you might be greeted by a line person waving his arms. He's not simply trying to get your attention, he's directing you to your parking spot.   

Once a line person begins to offer hand signals, trust but verify.  The ramp area is full of hidden obstacles and plenty of distractions so confirm what you are being instructed to do will keep you clear of other aircraft or obstructions.

The motions are standardized and have specific meanings which you can review in the Aeronautical Information Manual.  The most common ones you'll see are a turn, come straight ahead, and stop.  

Only after you shut the engine down will the line person approach your airplane to take your fuel order.  

Some pilots choose to hang around while fueling is taking place, just to double check that the right amount and type of fuel is being put in.  

If you’re taxing on to an FBO ramp after hours with no personnel, take cues from how other aircraft are parked and park into the wind.  

After securing the airplane, make sure the brakes are off in case the airplane has to be towed to an alternate location.

Self-serve fuel is becoming more readily available and it’s often cheaper and accessible 24 hours per day.  For your first self-fueling, we’d recommend getting supervision at your home airport.  

You’ll want to know how to position the nozzle, where to stand, and most importantly, where to ground the airplane.

As an aircraft flies through the air, it can accumulate static electricity. If the electricity is not dissipated before fueling, an arc could occur and ignite vapors. 

To prevent a potential arc, aircraft are electrically bonded to the fueling station or truck and not disconnected until after fueling is complete.

Remember that aircraft are loud and kick up a lot of wind which can be damaging to other aircraft and to any open doors. 

Be sure there is plenty of maneuvering room from where you start and that your taxi path won’t blow items around through an open hangar door.

It’s also courteous to avoid long periods on a crowded ramp or near a building with the engine running. After completing that after-start check, use gentle applications of power to carefully maneuver the airplane to a location away from people and buildings.  

Even at towered airports, there is generally a non-movement area where you may maneuver your airplane without obtaining a clearance. 

Like any new experience, flying into strange FBOs will seem awkward at first, but you'll soon learn that everyone else there is probably a flying buff too. You'll see what we mean when we say that the people in aviation are, indeed, a community.
















































12. Weather Theory
In the last video volume, we did not specifically discuss the weather associated with air masses and fronts. Now, we’ll take a look inside these air masses and see what happens to the weather when two air masses meet. This knowledge is important because pilots can then better judge the weather as it affects the safety and economy of a flight.

Air masses are defined as large bodies of air within which temperature and humidity are fairly uniform. 

Air masses are created whenever large bodies of air remain at a source region long enough to acquire the temperature and moisture characteristics of the earth’s surface in that region. 

Source regions are characterized by fairly uniform surface conditions such as oceans, snow-covered land, or deserts.

Most of the temperature and moisture modification takes place below 5,000 feet in what meteorologists call the “Planetary Boundary Layer.”

So, when conflicting air masses meet, the temperature and moisture differences are greatest here at the ground and at lower altitudes. 

The weather which results from this conflict is also most intense at lower altitudes and tends to diminish higher up, except in the case of thunderstorms which are violent through thousands of feet of the atmosphere…sometimes over 60,000 feet.

As air masses move from their source regions they come in contact with air masses of differing properties. The zone between contrasting air masses is called a front. The concept of fronts was developed by Scandinavian meteorologists during the First World War. 

What was happening between air masses reminded them of a battle between armies. Across the atmospheric battle zone, temperature, humidity, wind, and air pressure can all change very quickly over a short distance.

Most fronts are in troughs which extend from low pressure centers, though there are localized cold fronts that are not part of storm systems yet they can still create violent weather. 

Examples of such fronts are sea breeze or lake breeze fronts and they often produce powerful thunderstorms, dramatic temperature changes, and significant wind shifts.

While fronts, the boundaries of differing air masses, are regions of lower pressure, we generally find high pressure near the center of the air mass. 

Therefore, the most stable weather tends to be within the air mass, while the most unstable weather is found on its borders…along the fronts.

From a pilot's viewpoint, the position of a front aloft is just as important as the surface position. The frontal slope can be as steep as 1 to 50 and as shallow as 1 to 300. This means that an airplane 1 mile above the surface could cross the frontal zone in as little as fifty miles from the surface position if the frontal slope is steep, or you may have to fly as many as 300 miles beyond the surface position of the front, if the slope is shallow. All fronts slope towards cold air with increasing altitude.

A front is really a “zone” of change, not a thin line as it appears to be on a weather map. When moving across a front, from one air mass to the other, the change of temperature, wind, and humidity may be quite abrupt indicating a narrow frontal zone. 

But a gradual change of these properties indicates a broad diffuse frontal zone.

Temperature change is one of the most easily recognized differences you'll notice as you cross a front. Temperature change is more significant at low altitudes but differences in cloud cover across a front may obscure temperature changes.

Dew point change across a front and a change of the temperature/dew point spread help identify the location of the front and give clues to the potential for cloudiness and fog.

And speaking of fronts, winds almost always change direction when you cross a front, though some wind shifts are less obvious than others. The shifting wind requires a change in heading to maintain your course.

Without other influences, air would flow directly from high to low pressure, down the pressure gradient, but air flow is modified by the Coriolis force which is created by the earth's rotation. 

Because of the Coriolis Force, winds are deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere. Unlike winds aloft, the force of friction acts on the wind close to the ground. 

When the pressure gradient, Coriolis, and frictional forces act on the wind, the wind flow around low is counter-clockwise, or what we call cyclonic. Therefore, the terms low and cyclone are used interchangeably.

Flow around a high pressure center is clockwise or what we call anticyclonic. For that reason highs are also called anticyclones.

Because surface friction reduces wind speed, and since the Coriolis Force is proportional to wind speed, it’s impact near the ground is less than higher up. As a result of surface friction, surface winds are weaker than winds aloft and blow toward lower pressure. 

The angle at which surface winds cross isobars depends on wind velocity and topography and may be as little as 10 degrees over water and as much as 45 degrees over mountainous terrain.

When crossing the front, the change in wind direction calls for a heading change to the right in order to maintain course and that heading change is needed when crossing any front in any direction. Wind speed may also change across a front.


Pressure patterns may vary widely across fronts. The front is in a trough and the lowest pressure is at the front itself which means that higher pressure will be found on either side of the front. 

Generally, pressure in cold air masses will be somewhat higher than in warm air masses. In any case, there is a difference in the rate of pressure change which makes it very important to keep altimeter settings current.

Flying weather in fronts can vary from virtually clear to hazardous, including turbulence, hail, structural icing, and low ceilings and visibilities. 

The kind of weather you'll encounter in a front depends on many factors including the available moisture, stability of the air that is being lifted, speed of movement, temperature change across the front, frontal slope, and upper wind flow.

Fronts are classified as cold, warm, stationary, or occluded. Continuing the earlier analogy to warfare, fronts are named for the temperature change of the advancing air mass or for the properties of the front itself.

When cold air advances and replaces warmer air, the leading edge of the cold air is called a cold front. The chart symbol for the cold front is a line with triangles pointing in the direction of movement. 

On colored weather maps, cold fronts are blue. Behind me the movement is to the southeast and the cold air is advancing in that direction.

Cold fronts typically move toward the south, southeast, or east at speeds of 10 to 30 knots. Speed of movement depends on wind speeds behind the front, the strength of the low pressure associated with the cold front, and winds above the ground. 

Fast moving cold fronts have been observed moving at speeds greater than 50 knots. Cold fronts have an average slope of one mile vertically for every eighty miles horizontally.

Slow moving cold fronts have a shallower slope so the warm, humid air can move easily up and over the front. Therefore, precipitation develops generally along, and occasionally behind the surface position of the shallow cold front.

Fast moving cold fronts are steeper and often more intense. These fronts frequently produce precipitation along and ahead of the surface position of the front and lines of thunderstorms, called squall lines, can race hundreds of miles ahead of the front.

If warmer air is advancing, replacing colder air, the leading edge of the warmer air is called a warm front. Warm fronts are charted as half circles on a line pointing in the direction of movement and on colored-coded graphics, warm fronts are red. Here behind me the warm air is moving toward the northeast.

When compared to the cold front, warm fronts have a shallower slope and move slower than cold fronts. A point to remember: frontal slope is an indicator of how wide an area will be affected by frontal weather. 

Because warm fronts have a shallower slope, warm frontal weather is usually found over a much wider band than cold frontal weather.

Warm fronts are usually, but not always, less violent than cold fronts and can bring extensive areas of low stratus ceilings and poor visibilities. If the warm air is unstable there may be thunderstorms embedded in the massive layers of stratus clouds. Because of the shallow slope and slower movement, warm fronts affect aviation for longer period of time.

When the opposing forces on either side of a front reach a stalemate and the front moves at less than 5 knots it is called a stationary, or more correctly, a quasi-stationary front. Here the cold and warm front symbols are alternated, like those behind me.

The triangles of the cold front point away from the cold air and the half-circles of the warm front point away from the warm air. The symbols pointing in opposite directions graphically indicate lack of movement...or at least, very little movement.

In most cases, the weather associated with stationary fronts resembles stable warm fronts, but if the warm air is unstable, like the air moving northeastward here, convective activity such as thunderstorms may develop.

Low ceilings, visibilities, and other weather associated with the stationary front may affect an area for several days or even weeks.

During the day, solar energy warms the warm side more. Along the front the warm air mixes into the cold air, warming it and the warm front moves slightly northward.

At night radiational cooling is greater in the nearly cloud free skies in the warm air so the stationary front shifts south again. These oscillations can cause any location to have alternate warm and cold air mass weather several times over a few days.

As strong jet stream winds move over the stationary front, air starts to rise and rising air means lower pressure at the surface…and we have the birth of a new storm system. 

The development and life of a surface low pressure area is directly related to the strength of the jet stream which means there could be severe turbulence aloft, above the developing low.

Low pressure systems go through life cycles from a young or developing stage, through maturity to dissipation. As the storm system gets stronger, part of the stationary front ahead of the developing low moves north as a warm front while the portion of the front trailing the low becomes the new cold front. 

Low pressure systems become strongest in the “mature stage.” The strong low pulls cold and warm air together and since cold air travels faster than warm air, the cold front eventually catches up to the warm front forming what's called an occluded front.

An occluded front is symbolized by warm and cold front symbols on the same side of the line indicating the direction of movement, in this case to the northeast. 

On a color-coded weather map it generally looks purple, or sometimes pink…which is what you get when you combine the red and blue of the warm and cold front. 

Occluded fronts signal the start of the dying stage for storm systems and generally produce broad areas of unsettled weather.

The development of occluded fronts involves three distinct air masses, cool, warm, and cold, and the fronts are classified as either warm or cold occlusions. 

The classification is based on the relative temperature of the air mass associated with the approaching cold front.

A cold occlusion occurs when the arriving air is coldest and forces the warm air ahead of the front off the ground. In other words, the arriving cold air occludes or cuts off the flow of warm air into the low pressure center. 

The occluded boundary that forms is now between the cool air that already existed ahead of the old warm front and the arriving colder air. Most occlusions in the United States are the cold occlusion type.

If the air mass behind the cold front is not as cold as the air mass ahead of the old warm front, it is called a warm occlusion. When a warm occlusion passes, the temperature will rise because the arriving air is somewhat warmer than the air being displaced.

It was lift in the atmosphere and the battling air masses that initially created the storm system, but that same battle weakens the storm as colder air wraps around the low pressure center. With the temperature contrast eliminated and the jet stream energy gone, the fronts and low pressure center dissipate.

Frontal weather can be tricky and can change very rapidly. In some cases, a cold front may have only scattered clouds in the morning but produce a strong squall line in the afternoon.

The warm front may have partly cloudy skies in the afternoon, yet bring fog, drizzle, steady rain, thunderstorms, or even snow by nightfall.

Beware of the high pressure good weather, low pressure bad weather rule of thumb. While it's frequently true that high pressure days have good flying weather, this rule of thumb can occasionally fail in a spectacular display of poor weather under a high.

A good preflight weather briefing and a mental picture of what is happening and what is forecast to happen is essential.

Checking weather while in flight to keep the mental picture updated will provide the data necessary if a diversion has to be made.

Now let's talk some more about some of the weather information to which you have access to in making your flying decisions.

In the last volume we looked at the weather depiction and radar summary charts, which provide a broad overview of the weather.

We also looked at terminal aerodrome forecasts, TAFs, and hourly reports of surface observations, which are commonly called METARs.

TAFs and METARs are specific to a particular airport. In this volume we'll deal with several broad term forecasts as well as reports of actual weather conditions from other pilots.

In a few moments, we'll look at the forecast charts, TAFs, and METARs we showed you in volume three. You'll see that forecasters can often make reliable predictions.

Remember, if you check and compare radar summary charts, weather depiction charts, and hourly METARs with previous forecasts, you'll know how credible those forecasts were.













































































13. Closer Look: Weather Information
Let's take a closer look at some of the online resources available for obtaining preflight weather information.

While you always have the option to call Flight Service for a preflight weather briefing, you may find that looking at the weather data and imagery yourself can help provide a more complete picture of the weather before a flight.

The Lockheed Martin Flight Service website provides a good alternative to the phone weather briefing if you prefer the structured briefing approach, but would prefer the visual format on a computer or tablet. 

After registering for a free account at 1-800-W-X-BRIEF dot com, you can use the weather briefing function to enter your flight data and retrieve a standard weather briefing. 

The data will be presented in the same order as the phone briefer would provide, but with the added benefit of being able to see the weather reports, charts and radar imagery. 

Since this service is powered by the Flight Service stations, you can also file VFR flight plans here as well.

If you’re looking to view just a few text weather reports or forecast charts, another free online resource is Aviation Weather dot gov. 

This information comes directly from the National Weather Service, and provides all the standard weather products like METARs, TAFs, PIREPs, AIRMETs, radar imagery, and more.

It even includes a feature that allows you to overlay multiple weather reports, forecasts and radar imagery simultaneously on the map for a complete view of what’s going on with the weather around you.

There are also dedicated mobile apps available for phones and tablets that provide a complete source of preflight weather for pilots. You’ll probably find these to be the most convenient option since you’ll have it with you everywhere you go. 

The touchscreen interface makes it easy to view the weather right alongside your flightpath and chart, providing an excellent overview of your flight and potential alternate routes.

Most of the products from the national weather service are available here, including surface analysis, graphic winds aloft and turbulence forecasts. 

You can even retrieve a standard preflight weather briefing and file VFR flight plans right from the app if you prefer that method.

When you get to the airport, you may find a computer dedicated to displaying aviation weather. The most common provider is WSI, and allows you to view any last minute updates to the weather before heading out on your flight.

Take the time to learn each of these options and see what works best for you. When it comes to weather, a picture really is worth a thousand words.



























































14. Weather Data
Low-level significant weather prognostic charts are general visual weather forecasts designed for flight planning up to 24,000 feet. 

Prog charts provide a visual depiction of predicted weather. They are issued four times daily based on data at midnight, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Zulu times, also known as “Z” time. There are four panels on the prog chart.

The top panels forecast the weather conditions between the surface and 400 millibars of pressure which is approximately 24,000 feet.

Weather conditions at the surface are forecast by the bottom charts. The left hand panels are 12 hour progs and the right hand panels are 24 hour progs.

Extended surface forecasts, with slightly different symbology, are available out to 48 hours in the future.

Each panel has the valid time for the forecast indicated by the letters VT in the bottom left. The valid time is the specific time the forecaster expects the weather conditions indicated on the panel. 12 and 24 hour indicates the time of the weather reports on which the forecast was based.

Both the 12 and 24 hour chart are based on the known weather conditions which existed at zero Zulu, June 16th. From a practical standpoint, the 12 and 24 hour label may be an indication of the reliability of the forecast. 

Long term forecasts are usually less reliable than those made for a shorter period, but improvements in models and forecast skill have greatly increased the reliability of forecasts out to 48 hours and beyond.

Weather is dynamic, it just never stands still. To determine expected conditions beyond the valid time of the 12 hour prog it is necessary to interpolate between it and the 24 hour prog.

The surface prog outlines areas of forecast precipitation and thunderstorms. Forecast for the type of precipitation and amount of coverage is also shown.

Forecast areas of IFR and marginal VFR weather are indicated on the top two panels. The forecast bases and tops of moderate or greater turbulence as well as forecast freezing levels are also shown.

The common standard weather symbols used on the prog are rain, drizzle, and snow. Duplicate symbols indicate light rain, drizzle or light snow. 

Moderate and heavy rain or snow are shown respectively with triple and quadruple copies of the symbols.

Rain and snow symbols, above a triangle, denote showers. Showers represent precipitation that starts and stops and varies in intensity.

Symbols for moderate and severe turbulence as well as thunderstorms, like these, are graphically suggestive.

Less commonly used symbols are freezing rain and drizzle, tropical storms, and hurricanes. Symbols used for areas of predicted IFR weather, marginal VFR, moderate or greater turbulence and freezing levels are shown at the bottom of the 12 and 24 panels. Criteria for IFR and marginal VFR are listed inside the symbols.

This is the 12-hour significant weather prog chart, valid for 12Z on June 16th. There is an area of IFR weather surrounded by an area of marginal VFR weather forecast for the east coast extending across North and South Carolina. 

IFR and Marginal VFR conditions are also called for in the Gulf Coast and extends up through the Central Plains. 

An area of moderate turbulence is predicted in the southwestern United States extending from 16 thousand feet down to the surface.

Freezing levels, depicted by the turquoise short-dashed lines, are forecast at 8 thousand feet MSL in the Pacific Northwest, 12 thousand feet from Northern California to Wisconsin and 16 thousand feet in a small area in southern Texas.

A freezing level at the surface would be depicted by a zigzag line.

On the surface prog a cold front is forecast to stretch from a Low in southeastern Canada down through southern Missouri. There are also several stationary fronts predicted in the western third of the US.

Precipitation areas are bounded by dark lines. The shading implies that more than half of the area is forecast to have precipitation. 

If the area is not shaded, the forecast is for 30 to 50 percent of the area to have precipitation. On this chart it’s easy to see that the precipitation is predicted to be more concentrated around the cold front in the midwest.

Seven surface lows are forecast with troughs extending from most in the western third of the US. Highs are expected primarily on the east coast, extending from New England down through the Florida pan-handle. The central pressure of each high and low is indicated in millibars by the four digit number.

Let’s now move on from the prog charts to area forecasts. Area forecasts are predictions of general weather conditions for an area the size of several states. 

Six area forecasts cover the contiguous 48 states. Each forecast is further broken down into states, parts of states, and other geographical designations.

Issued 3 times daily, each area forecast covers a 12-hour period with an additional 6-hour outlook.

Area forecasts consist of four sections: a product header telling you where and when the forecast applies, a precautionary statement advising how to use the forecast and where to seek additional information, a synopsis, which is a brief summary of the weather systems and phenomena affecting the area for the 18-hour period, and finally, a VFR clouds and weather section which composes the bulk of the area forecast. 

This section gives a general description of clouds and weather which cover an area greater than 3,000 square miles and is significant to VFR flight operations.

Concluding each area's clouds and weather section is the outlook for the last six hours of the 18-hour period covered by the area forecast. The outlook will give a broad description of flight conditions – VFR, marginal VFR, or IFR. The criteria for VFR, marginal VFR, and IFR are the same as those used and printed on the weather depiction chart.

The outlook may also include significant weather phenomena such as wind, ceilings, thunderstorms, etc.

As with any forecast, the area forecast is usually more accurate for the beginning of the forecast period. Checking the present weather conditions against the forecast weather is the best way to assess the reliability of the forecast. Let's go through part of this area forecast issued from Boston.

The "C" following the three letter identifier indicates a forecast containing clouds and weather. This was issued on the seventh of the month at 18-45 Zulu. The synopsis is valid until the eighth at 13 "Z." 

Clouds and weather are only valid until the eighth of the month at 7 "Z", and the outlook valid time begins at zero seven hundred Zulu and goes until 1300 Zulu.

The area covered by the forecast includes Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Lake Ontario, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Lake Erie, West Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, and coastal waters. The highlights of this forecast are found in the precautionary statements.

The first is to alert you to check AIRMET sierra to see if IFR conditions and/or mountain obscurations may be occurring or may be forecast to occur.

This second statement reminds you severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, low level wind shear, and IFR conditions may be associated with thunderstorms. These thunderstorm-related hazards will not be spelled out within the body of the area forecast.

The third and final precautionary statement is that altitudes not shown as above mean sea level will be denoted by "above ground level" or as a "ceiling." As you may remember, ceilings are, by definition, above ground level. In general, altitudes are MSL on area forecasts.

Moving on to the synopsis: At 19 "Z," a cold front was positioned from western Lake Erie across southwestern Ohio through southwestern Kentucky. A warm front extended from southwestern Quebec through northern Vermont curving through extreme southwestern Maine.

By the end of the forecast period which is 1300 Zulu, the low will be in southeastern Ontario with a cold front extending through western New York, southwestern Pennsylvania, Beckley, West Virginia, Anderson, South Carolina, Tallahassee, Florida, and into the Gulf of Mexico.

The first state detailed is Maine and that is further divided into the northwestern two-thirds and the southeastern one-third. In the northwestern two-thirds, clouds are forecast broken to overcast at two to three thousand feet mean sea level with tops layered to flight level two five zero which is about the same as 25,000 feet.

The forecast calls for visibility of three to five statute miles in mist.
There should be widely scattered areas where the visibility will be three to five statute miles in light rain and mist.

From 20 to 22 "Z," skies are forecast to be overcast at two to three thousand feet MSL.
Occasionally there should be light rain and light drizzle. "Occasionally" means there's a greater than 50 percent probability but it will occur for less than 1/2 the forecast period.

Visibility during the period remains three to five statute miles with some form of precipitation and mist. The outlook calls for IFR conditions due to ceilings, rain, mist, and fog.

The southeastern one-third of Maine is forecast to have overcast ceilings at one to two thousand feet and tops of the clouds layered to flight level two five zero.

Visibility should be three to five statute miles in light rain and drizzle. The outlook is also for IFR conditions due to ceilings, light rain, mist, and fog.

For new Hampshire and Vermont, the northern half is forecast to have broken to overcast skies at twenty-five hundred feet and tops layered to flight level two five zero. Occasionally, visibilities should be three to five statute miles in light rain showers.

From 0300 Zulu to 0500 Zulu clouds should be overcast at twenty-five hundred feet, and visibility of three to five statute miles in light rain showers.

The outlook is for marginal VFR due to ceilings, rain showers, and mist. The southern half of New Hampshire and Vermont should have broken to overcast clouds at one thousand to two thousand feet with tops layered to flight level two five zero, with visibilities from three to five statute miles in light drizzle and mist.

The outlook is for IFR conditions due to ceilings, drizzle, mist, and fog. You can see from this example that area forecasts are not hard to read or understand. 

They are useful for long-range planning but when it comes time to launch into the elements, you'll want more specific and timely reports and forecasts. That's where the METARs and TAFs we covered in the last volume come into play.

You can obtain and contribute recent airborne information about cloud tops, icing, and turbulence using pilot reports. They are the only means of obtaining certain critical information for briefers and for forecasters.

The letters UA identify pilot reports, UUA is used to identify urgent pilot reports. Pilot reports, or PIREPS as they are called, follow a standard format. Following the letters UA or UUA will be the location, time, altitude, aircraft type, and weather reported. Elements not reported are omitted from the report.

The location given in a PIREP may be given in relation to a known geographic designation or on a certain radial at a given distance from a VOR. PIREPS of icing and turbulence will usually indicate the type of aircraft the pilot was flying at the time they made the report.

The type of aircraft will give you an idea of the usefulness and validity of the report to you. Moderate turbulence reported by a Cessna 172 at 3000 feet would not be of much use to a 787 captain. However, a 172 pilot should be very interested in moderate turbulence reported by a 787 crew at 3000 feet.

Here is an example of a pilot report, over Boston at 14-44-Zulu during climb reported by a Boeing 787. Sky cover, base of the scattered clouds 2,300 MSL, base of the overcast 3000 feet MSL, weather instrument meteorological conditions at 10,000 feet MSL. The letters F-L are for indicated altitude. 

For airplanes at and above 18,000 feet MSL it is the flight level. Here's an urgent pilot report from Great Falls, Montana on the 180 degree radial of and 30 miles from the VOR at 1550 Zulu. At 10,000 to 11,000 feet MSL a Cessna 310 reported freezing rain and light rime icing. 

You’ll find it especially useful to view PIREPs as an overlay on an interactive map. Here you can view the PIREP in relation to other weather reports and imagery to get a better idea for what might be causing the reported conditions. 

You can also filter what’s shown here based on age, altitude and type of hazard reported.

PIREPS are an important part of the weather briefing. The most reliable observation of in-flight weather is the one made from the cockpit of an aircraft. 

PIREPs always help other pilots and become part of the aviation weather service. Pilots are requested to please report anything observed that may be of concern to other pilots.



















































15. Closer Look: Tablets in the Cockpit
Today, pilots are using tablets to assist with just about every aspect of flying. These devices can help you plan cross-country flights, provide preflight weather briefings, display electronic sectional charts, show GPS moving maps and much, much more.

Even with these advances in mobile computing technology, there’s a good chance your flight instructor will still teach you how to plan and fly your first few cross-country flights with a paper chart, plotter, E6B, pen and paper, leaving your tablet on the sidelines. Despite what you may think, he’s not trying to punish you. 

The knowledge you gain by learning “the old school method” will allow you to appreciate the speed and simplicity that tablets provide, but more importantly it will help understand the fundamental concepts and calculations used in flight planning. 

And don’t forget you have to do it by hand on the knowledge test.

After mastering the fundamentals of paper flight planning, pilotage and dead reckoning, you can then transition to using an app and tablet to automate routine calculations if you choose. 

And you’ll also be better equipped to identify any potential planning errors.

Most of the aviation apps available today include electronic versions of all the VFR Sectional and Terminal Area Charts, meaning you won’t be required to carry paper sectionals or A/FDs for navigation and airport info if you go that route. 

And best of all, when using your tablet with a GPS source you’ll see your airplane’s position right on the chart.

Before throwing your paper charts out the window and relying on a tablet, there are a few items you should become familiar with. 

The first is a basic understanding of the legalities that relate to flying with Electronic Flight Bags, or EFBs -- the term the FAA uses to describe tablets in the cockpit. 

FAR 91.21 requires that you verify your EFB (or any electronic device for that matter) will not cause interference with the navigation or communications systems installed on the aircraft.

You’ll also want to become familiar with Advisory Circular 91-78, which provides guidance to pilots using EFBs to replace paper charts in the cockpit. 

This AC says that it’s ok to substitute electronic charts for paper in flight, but you must adhere to the following guidelines. 

First you’ll need an application that displays the charts on the tablet, and the charts and data must be kept current. 

New data and chart updates are available for download every 28 days right in your aviation application.

Next, AC 91-78 recommends bringing along a backup source, such as a paper chart or second EFB, but this is not mandatory. 

Finally, the guidance suggests using the tablet first during an evaluation period with paper charts still accessible before relying solely on the electronic device for your charts in flight.

Another important consideration is how to secure the tablet in a way that allows for easy operation during all phases of flight, and to make sure it doesn’t fall out of reach when flying through rough air. 

The first option is a kneeboard, which keeps it locked down on your leg and within reach. An alternative is to mount it in the cockpit using a dedicated mounting bracket made specifically for aviation, either to the yoke or a side window. 

After gaining some experience you’ll find that using a tablet in the cockpit can increase the safety and efficiency of your flights.

And as you become more familiar with the device’s capability you’ll learn how a tablet can do much more than just automate flight planning and replace paper charts. 

When combined with certain wireless accessories it can even display in-flight METARs and weather radar, show nearby traffic and even provide backup flight instruments.

Despite all these capabilities, resist the urge to use the tablet for all your flight planning needs from day one.

Use a balanced approach with your instructor and take the time to learn the math that goes into these calculations and how to plan a trip by hand from start to finish. 

That way when you transition to a paperless cockpit with your tablet you’ll have a better understanding of the conveniences a device like this provides--and be prepared for an emergency.



















































































16. The Dual Cross Country Flight
The cross-country portion of your flight training is an exciting time, where you’ll leave the local practice area and fly out to new airports. 

Next we’re going to demonstrate a typical cross-country training scenario beginning at the Clermont County Airport.

You and your instructor have checked the weather, filled out the flight log, and filed a flight plan for each leg of the flight. 

After a thorough preflight inspection, and getting the cockpit organized, you make the necessary radio calls before taking the runway – and you're off!

After reaching pattern altitude on the departure leg, exit the pattern at a 45 degree angle. Then turn on course when clear of the airport vicinity and at least 500 feet above the pattern.

After starting the timer in the  E6B, the first job is to get established on course and on altitude. 

In our case, 3,500. So, assume the initial heading of 49 degrees and begin looking for Owensville and the racetrack – your first checkpoint. There they are – which means you're on course.

Log the time over the checkpoint and continue on course. Contact flight service and activate the flight plan for your first leg. 

Use the nearby Cincinnati remote communications outlet with Flight Service.

Now that you are at the 3,500 foot cruising altitude, adjust the power to your cruise setting, and lean the mixture.

Double check the conditions for determining true airspeed. A quick glance at the OAT gauge confirms that the outside air temperature is one degree Celsius, so the true airspeed calculations are valid.

Remember to continue your scan. Don't get so caught up in flight management and duties in the cockpit that you forget to scan!

The flight passes near several airports, which is extra incentive to remain vigilant! Log the time over the lakes. 

Do a groundspeed check at the next checkpoint. Right after crossing the next road, you should see the town of Midland off to the left. There's the road, and there's Midland. 

The heading is holding the desired course, so your preflight information and planning must have been accurate. The groundspeed check on the  E6B is very close to the estimated 97 knots.

The next checkpoint was a road and railroad together – those are pretty easy to see. Our planned route takes us through the Wilmington Class D airspace. 

We must establish radio communications before entering the Class D, so we'll give Wilmington tower a call.

(Skycatcher 3030N) “Wilmington tower, Skycatcher 3-0-3-0 November , about 6 miles south at 3 thousand 5 hundred feet, heading northeast toward Fayette County, request transition through your airspace."

(Wilmington Tower) “Cessna three zero three zero november, Wilmington Tower, transition through the Class Delta airspace approved.”

There's the town of Wilmington on the left and Airborne Airpark just this side of it. Log the time by that fix and you're on the final stretch to Washington Courthouse and Fayette County airport. Off to the left is Sabina and the road leading to Washington Courthouse.

Up ahead is Washington Courthouse, so prepare for approach and landing to Fayette County. A quick call to Fayette County UNICOM on 122.8 is in order to get an airport advisory.

Fayette County's altitude is 980 feet and the Airport/Facility Directory lists pattern altitude as 1780 feet.

The current altitude is three thousand five hundred feet and you're still about 7 miles away. Remember, plan to arrive at the pattern altitude before reaching the airport. 

So, begin a descent in plenty of time. With the airport in sight, you can make a quick call to flight service and close the flight plan for your first leg.

Don't forget the pre-landing checklist and keep listening to the Common Traffic Advisory frequency for other traffic and make your calls specifying what you're doing.

(Skycatcher 3030N) “Fayette County traffic, Skycatcher 3-0-3-0 November is two miles to the southwest, will be entering an upwind for runway five, Fayette County.”

Once in the pattern, quickly log the time of arrival at the airport and concentrate on the landing. Keep scanning.

Let’s do a full stop landing and taxi back for an immediate takeoff.

(Skycatcher 3030N) “Fayette County traffic, Skycatcher 3-0-3-0 November departing runway five. We’ll be departing to the west. Fayette County.”

After reaching pattern altitude on the departure leg, exit the pattern at a 45 degree angle, then turn on course when clear of the airport vicinity. Activate your next flight plan. Climb to your planned altitude of 4 thousand 5 hundred on this leg of the flight.

Picking up your heading, the first checkpoint is the road and railroad track which you should cross at an angle.

What may be sinking in right about now is that you have successfully flown an airplane from point "A" to point "B"! The first leg of the trip seemed like it went pretty fast, that's because you were busy without much time to sit back and reflect! 

The same is true now, so back to work! Coming up on the right is the lake, right where it's expected to be, so we're on course.

Noting the times across the checkpoints, it sure does seem that they're not coming as quickly as before, which makes sense. We're flying into a headwind, so the groundspeed is slower.

A groundspeed check shows that the groundspeed is lower than planned which means the wind speed must be greater than forecast.

Looking at the OAT shows the temperature is also higher. That makes sense because the sun is warming things up.

Recalculating true airspeed shows it's increased a little, but not much. Off to the right is the town of Xenia, the road leading there, and Greene County airport to the west.

Looking out the front you can see the city of Dayton coming up. Passing over I-75, Moraine Airpark is to the right.

Either the wind has blown you off course or, in doing all this looking around, the heading has drifted a bit!

Out the front left we see the little town of Farmersville, a VFR checkpoint for calling Dayton air traffic control.

Recalculating groundspeed based on this new position check indicates the winds are remaining pretty much constant.

Richmond has an AWOS facility on the field, so it’s a good idea to tune it in and get an update on the local winds and weather.

The private airstrip Morning Star North is there on the left. A little further on is the town of Eaton and the racetrack to the east. That means your position is about ten miles out from Richmond airport.

Checking your sectional, notice that there is a parachute jumping symbol associated with the airport. You will want to be on the lookout for any parachuting activity as you make your approach.

A call to Richmond UNICOM on 122.7 reveals that they're using runway 15. This agrees with the light winds reported on the AWOS.

Richmond airport has multiple runways, but identifying runway 15 is simple. You know that the runway number is aligned with magnetic direction. 

The fact that there's a compass rose on the chart around the VOR, and that the VOR is on the field, makes it that much easier.

The runway running southeast/northwest is runway 15/33. From our direction, we'll make a standard 45 degree entry to the downwind leg of the pattern. This will be a full stop landing because a pit-stop and something to drink are in order.

Richmond has a remote communications outlet located on the field using the VOR. You can close the flight plan for this leg after taxiing clear of the runway. 

To use this RCO, transmit on 122.1 and listen over the VOR frequency.

At an airport with multiple runways, sometimes it's required to taxi across other runways going to the parking area.

Even if they're not the "active" runways, always look and announce your intentions prior to moving onto any runway. 

At non-towered fields, you're on your own to exercise vigilance. At tower-controlled fields, permission is granted by ground or tower controllers to cross runways.

After refreshing yourself, and collecting your thoughts, off you go again on the final leg. Another preflight is a good idea, just in case something went awry during the flight. 

Activate your flight plan using the RCO after your run-up and before announcing your intentions to takeoff on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency.

Exit from the Richmond pattern will be straight out from runway 15, on course back to Clermont County. Climb to 3 thousand 5 hundred as your cruising altitude on this final leg.

Off to the right is the road paralleling our course. So, you know we're pretty close to where we should be. Off to the right is the large lake. Further south is the town of Oxford.

Just beyond Oxford is the edge of the Cincinnati Class B airspace. At 3,500 feet, we're flying underneath the Class B, so no contact with ATC is required.

There's the city of Hamilton and the Butler county Regional airport. A groundspeed check indicates the wind speed has increased again. You're making great time.

You're halfway home, and on course. After crossing I-75, there's Blue Ash airport.

A quick call to Clermont County UNICOM tells you your crosswind skills will be needed. The tailwind that helps you get home is a crosswind for runway 22.

Begin descending further away this time because your groundspeed is higher. Looking ahead, there's the divided highway running just north of the airport.

Approaching from the north-northwest to runway 22, enter mid-upwind on the 45 degree angle, announcing your pattern all the way to turning final. 

If you haven't already closed it in the air, don’t forget to close your flight plan after landing using a telephone.

What you probably realize by now is that flying cross-country is a lot of fun. And there's a lot to do to keep you busy. Just remember to keep scanning, follow the checklists, and adhere to procedures and you should be fine. 

Everything went smoothly on this flight. But we'll find out in later what happens when things don't go so smoothly.









































































17. VFR Flight Following
While flying VFR, it can be useful to have an extra set of eyes on your flight. Radar flight following can be a valuable resource. 

Flight following is an optional service in Class E airspace provided by ATC to VFR aircraft on a workload permitting basis. 

When taking part in flight following, the VFR aircraft is radar identified and in communication with a controller. 

This allows the controller to provide traffic advisories and other assistance to the aircraft. In return, the controller gets a confirmation of the aircraft's identity, route of flight, and altitude. 

This allows the controller to provide improved service to IFR traffic in the area as well. Primary navigation along with "see and avoid" responsibilities remain with the VFR pilot. 

Flight following may be requested from an air route traffic control center or from a terminal radar approach control facility. ARTCC or "center" frequencies may be found in the chart supplement. 

Tracon or "approach" frequencies may be found on the sectional chart and in the chart supplement. If you need to leave the frequency for a few minutes to update weather, simply advise the controller of this. 

You might also want to listen to a recorded weather broadcast such as the ASOS from a nearby airport or HIWAAS over a nearby VOR. 

You may be able to do this without leaving the flight following frequency. Simply select the audio output for the second radio on your audio panel while maintaining the output on the ATC radio. 

Listen carefully to both giving ATC's frequency the priority. Sample of ATC on one frequency while listening to weather broadcast on another. 

At times, ATC will coordinate your flight following with the next sector and hand you off to a controller on another frequency. 

At other times, the controller's workload may not allow this direct handoff. As a VFR pilot, you may also cancel the flight following yourself.

















18. Closer Look: Sporty's E6B
Let's take a closer look at E6B flight computers.  These devices were invented during World War II to help military pilots with flight planning and navigation. 

The name E6B comes from the original product number given to them by the US Army Air Corps, and we still use that term today. 

They initially took the form of a spinnable disc, commonly called a whiz wheel.

While the E6B has evolved significantly over the years into electronic and computer versions, they still rely on the same basic math used by the cardboard wheels of the 1930s and 40s.

In this course we used the Sporty’s handheld E6B to demonstrate flight planning earlier in this volume. This E6B model includes 24 aviation functions, 20 aviation conversions and a weight and balance function to help with all your preflight planning.

The Sporty’s E6B is approved for use on the FAA knowledge test. Grouping certain functions together will make it easier to answer questions requiring calculations on the test and make flight planning more convenient.

You’ll find that the Sporty’s E6B is just as useful in the air too. You can easily determine your true airspeed, groundspeed, top of descent, hourly fuel burn and much more.

In addition to the electronic model, the Sporty’s E6B is also available for download as a mobile app for phones and tablets in the online app stores. 

While you can’t use this version during your FAA knowledge test, you’ll find it very helpful to have with you everywhere you go.

























19. Normal Airspace
Understanding the airspace system is easy once you grasp this concept: the designation of a parcel of airspace is driven by what goes on there. In the wide open spaces of the west, airplanes are so few and far between, that we don't need many restrictions.

The purpose of the different airspace rules is safety.  Some areas of the U.S. have more flights than others.  Therefore, the FAA has implemented Classes of airspace to reflect this activity.  The level of control goes from zero in some areas to considerable control around congested, big city, airports.

Airspace can be divided into Controlled, Uncontrolled, Special Use and Other. Airspace designation is arrived at by considering the density of aircraft, the types of operations, the level of safety required, and the national and public interest.

Controlled airspace is generally where ATC service is provided.  There are different requirements if the flight is IFR or VFR. For example, a pilot flying IFR in controlled airspace will have to file an IFR flight plan and receive an ATC clearance.  He will be provided with standard aircraft separation.

For VFR flight, controlled airspace means increased cloud clearance and visibility requirements.  For the VFR pilot flying in B, C, and D airspace, there are communication and/or clearance requirements.

U.S. airspace conforms to the International Civil Aviation Organization system. The International Civil Aviation Organization, called ICAO classifies airspace by the letters A through G, A being the most restrictive, G having the least constraints placed on it.

As we begin discussing airspace there’s one interesting note about these classifications. There's no Class F airspace in the United States.  This is because the U.S. has no equivalent to ICAO Class F, Where ATC provides separation for IFR aircraft only so far as practical.

Now, let's begin with Class A airspace which starts at eighteen thousand feet MSL and extends up to and including flight level six zero zero. Remember, the flight levels are based on pressure altitudes and pilots operating at and above eighteen thousand feet MSL reset their altimeters to the standard pressure setting of two nine point nine two.

Flight level altitudes are expressed in hundreds of feet. For example flight level three five zero is a pressure altitude of thirty-five thousand feet. All operations in Class A must be conducted under instrument flight rules, which is another way of saying that you can't fly at and above eighteen thousand feet MSL VFR. You must be instrument rated and equipped, obtain an ATC clearance before entering Class A and maintain two-way radio contact with ATC while operating in Class A. Class A covers all of the lower 48 states and the eastern section of Alaska. Class A airspace is not depicted on charts. The main users of class A airspace are the airlines, the military, and business aircraft. They all tend to be fast movers, so ATC keeps a good handle on who's doing what up there and provides ample vertical and horizontal separation for all aircraft.

Also watched closely is class B airspace. Located around airports where there's a large volume of air traffic, class B airspace, often compared to an upside down wedding cake in shape, begins at the surface and extends upward to a designated altitude typically ten thousand feet.

Aircraft inside class B are permitted to maintain two hundred fifty knots indicated airspeed, the speed limit for operations below ten thousand feet M-S-L.  However, aircraft operating below the overhanging layers of class B airspace are limited to two hundred knots indicated airspeed.

Before operating in class B, you must receive authorization from A-T-C, maintain two-way radio communications with A-T-C and have an operating transponder with altitude reporting and ADS-B out capabilities.

Private pilots may operate at all airports within class B. Student pilots cannot takeoff, land, or fly solo in that airspace unless they have received ground and flight instruction for the specific Class B airspace.  The student's logbook must have been endorsed within the previous ninety days by the instructor who gave the flight instruction. Recreational and Sport pilots may fly in Class B airspace once they have received the necessary training and an instructor endorsement. At some busier Class B areas such as Chicago and Los Angeles, student pilots may not take off or land at the primary airport.

There are a couple of other special cases in these rules. First, an aircraft without a transponder or ADS-B out may operate in Class B if the request for the deviation is made to A-T-C at least one hour prior to the proposed operation. Second, authorization to deviate from the altitude reporting requirement may be given immediately. The minimum V-F-R visibility in Class B is three statute miles and you must stay clear of clouds. Class B is shown on terminal area, sectional, and low altitude en route charts.

Let's look at Cleveland as an example. Class B boundaries are shown with heavy blue lines. There are four layers in all, let's begin in the middle and work our way out.
The top of the airspace is eight thousand feet M-S-L and in the vicinity of Cleveland International, it extends to the surface. The next layer starts at one thousand nine hundred feet M-S-L. The next layer at three thousand feet M-S-L. And the outside layer begins at four thousand feet M-S-L. Flying within thirty nautical miles of the primary airport you must have an operating transponder and altitude reporting and ADS-B out capability if the aircraft was certified with an engine driven electrical system and is not classified as a balloon or glider.

You'll typically see lots of airline traffic in Class B airspace, usually heaviest around pushes as a carrier lands or departs many of its airplanes close together. This is a result of the hub and spoke system the airlines use and it's best to avoid Class B areas altogether around push time. The airlines are also referred to as scheduled carriers, and from these schedules you can know when a push is going to happen, or, the tower at the primary airport will usually be happy to tell a pilot when it's best not to show up.

Class C airspace surrounds airports handling a moderate volume of air traffic and resembles a two-layer upside-down wedding cake in shape.  It typically extends four thousand feet above the surface.

To operate in Class C, you'll need to establish communications with ATC and hold at least a student pilot certificate. Note that no clearance is required to enter Class C, just establishment of communications.  This can be as simple as the controller acknowledging your call sign. A transponder with altitude reporting and ADS-B out capability is required within and above Class C airspace.

For VFR flight a minimum visibility of 3 statute miles is required and you must remain five hundred feet below, one thousand feet above and two thousand feet laterally away from clouds. You will find Class C airspace on Terminal Area, Sectional, and Low Altitude En Route charts. It's depicted by solid magenta circles on VFR charts.

This is the Class C area surrounding the Fort Wayne International airport. The first layer, called the inner circle, begins at the surface and extends to the top at forty-eight hundred feet MSL. The inner circle has a radius of five nautical miles from the airport. The second layer has a radius of ten nautical miles and has a base of two thousand feet MSL.
Traffic advisories are provided to all aircraft in Class C.

In Class C and Class D, unless otherwise authorized, you may not exceed two hundred knots indicated airspeed within four nautical miles of the primary airport, at or below twenty-five hundred feet AGL.

Class D airspace surrounds tower-controlled airports that do not have an associated Class B or C area. You must establish two-way radio communications with ATC before operating in Class D airspace, but a clearance is not required. You must possess a minimum of a student pilot certificate.  Recreational and sport pilots with a sign-off may also fly in Class D airspace.

Class D airspace is depicted on VFR charts with a segmented blue line. Many have arrival extensions, giving the airspace the shape of a keyhole. The vertical boundary is charted inside a blue segmented box in hundreds of feet MSL. The top of this Class D airspace is twenty-five hundred feet MSL.

VFR traffic advisories from ATC are provided on a workload permitting basis. Some towers operate part time, and when the tower is not in operation, Class D airspace reverts to the less restrictive Class E or G airspace.

Class E airspace is controlled airspace that is not included in Classes A, B, C, or D.  It extends upward from the surface at some non-towered airports, or up from a floor of either seven hundred or twelve hundred feet AGL.  It extends up to, but not including, eighteen thousand feet unless there is an overlying B or C airspace. Radio contact is not required to fly VFR in Class E airspace.

Cloud clearances in Class E and below ten thousand feet MSL are five hundred feet below, one thousand feet above and two thousand feet horizontally from clouds.  Below ten thousand feet MSL three miles visibility is required.

At and above ten thousand feet MSL and more than twelve hundred feet AGL, this increases to five miles visibility and cloud clearances of a thousand feet above and below and one statute mile horizontally. To takeoff, land, or enter the traffic pattern of an airport in class e airspace, you must have a minimum ceiling of one thousand feet and a minimum visibility of three statute miles.

One exception to this requirement is a special VFR clearance, which must be requested by the pilot. Special VFR allows VFR flight to and from airports in controlled airspace with a minimum visibility of one mile and still remaining clear of clouds. At 90 knots, 1 mile visibility gives you about 45 seconds of forward visibility.  Used wisely, special VFR can help you cope with very localized conditions. Resist the temptation to fly special VFR in unfamiliar territory or for more than a few miles.

Special VFR at night is even more of a special case. Realizing this, the FAA requires an instrument rating to be cleared for Special VFR at night. No Special VFR is allowed inside the inner ring of airspace surrounding airports with the notation NO SVFR above the airport name. In addition, the box around this airport's name indicates coverage by Far Part 93, covering special traffic rules and patterns.

Class E airspace is depicted on VFR charts in various ways. Class E airspace having a floor of 700 feet AGL is encompassed within a magenta vignette.  The airspace outside of these magenta vignettes is assumed to be Class E with a floor of twelve hundred feet AGL. When Class E airspace, with a floor of 1200 feet AGL, abuts Class G airspace, it's charted with a blue vignette. This is most common in the Western United States.  These blue vignettes are framing a federal airway . . .

Class E controlled airspace with a floor of 1200 feet AGL along the airway and feathered side of the vignette and uncontrolled Class G airspace on the sharp side of the vignette.
Air Traffic Service routes, including federal airways, are designated routes between navigational facilities or waypoints. This airway is V528. The Victor identifies the VOR as the navigational facility defining the airway.

In cases where the floor of class E is other than seven hundred or twelve hundred AGL, but less than fourteen thousand five hundred feet MSL, it's depicted by jagged blue lines and the floor is marked in AGL or, in some areas, MSL altitudes, most often near airways or NAVAIDs.

Some of the Class D airport extensions are also designated full-time Class E airspace.  These are depicted by magenta segmented lines.

Some non-towered airports are surrounded by Class E airspace that goes all the way to the surface.  These are depicted by a segmented magenta line.

Except where charted at a lower altitude, Class E airspace begins at fourteen thousand five hundred MSL and extends up to, but not including, eighteen thousand MSL over the forty-eight contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska and coastal waters, not including the area west of one hundred sixty degrees west longitude or airspace less than fifteen hundred AGL. For the really high fliers, Class E begins again above flight level six zero zero, with no upper limit.

That brings us to Class G airspace, also referred to as uncontrolled airspace. Hark back to our previous discussion and remember that airports with magenta vignettes have a Class E floor of seven hundred feet AGL, which is also the ceiling of Class G. You'll find these airports also have an instrument approach procedure.

The rules for operating in Class G are fairly simple. You don't have to talk to anybody or get permission to be there.
You do need certain visibility and cloud clearances for VFR operations, though, which vary by altitude and whether it's day or night.  We'll begin with visibility and start at the ground and work our way up.

Below ten thousand feet MSL, visibility must be one mile. At night this goes up to three miles. At or above ten thousand feet MSL and more than twelve hundred feet AGL, day and night, this increases to five miles.

Let's do the same thing for cloud clearances.  Twelve hundred feet or less above the ground, you have to stay clear of clouds. Between twelve hundred feet AGL and nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine feet MSL you must remain five hundred feet below, one thousand feet above and two thousand feet horizontally from clouds. Above twelve hundred feet AGL and at or above ten thousand feet MSL you must stay a thousand feet below, a thousand above and one statute mile laterally from clouds.












































































20. Special Use Airspace
Up to this point, our airspace discussions have included weather, aircraft equipment and pilot qualifications. Now we're going to talk about Special Use airspace which establishes limitations on the use of the airspace itself.

Special Use airspace consists of Prohibited, Restricted, Warning, Military Operation, Alert, and Controlled Firing Areas.

Prohibited areas specifically prohibit aircraft flight. Period. The Prohibited airspace, P-40, protects the Presidential retreat at Camp David in north-central Maryland.
The tabulation of Special Use airspace on this chart defines its vertical extent "to but not including five thousand feet."  It is in effect continuously.

It's important to check the NOTAMs if you'll be flying around these areas.  Some of the dimensions change in size. For example, 40 expands from its normal diameter of six nautical miles to twenty nautical miles when the President is there.

Restricted Areas are defined as airspace where aircraft flight is subject to restrictions. Restricted Area 6612 is in effect to seven thousand feet Monday through Friday between zero eight hundred and seventeen hundred local time.  At times other than those, "R" six six one two can be activated with forty-eight hours notice. Therefore, pilots should check with the Washington air route traffic control center whenever they plan to fly through this area.

Warning Areas are in international airspace. Activities in Warning Areas may be hazardous to non-participating aircraft. Warning Areas cannot be designated Restricted Areas because they are over international waters. Warning Area W-72B on the Washington Sectional chart advises flight in the area is hazardous.

Military Operation Areas, MOA's, are segments of airspace defined by vertical and lateral limits used to segregate military training activities from aircraft operating under instrument flight rules. Most military training requires abrupt maneuvering and high speed. In an MOA, military pilots are exempted from FAA regulations prohibiting acrobatics in certain airspace and on federal airways. MOA's identify areas where these activities are conducted.  Pilots should check with the ATC facility listed on the chart for real-time information about an MOA's status.
VFR flight is permitted in active MOA's, but requires extreme caution and vigilance.  IFR flights will usually not be cleared to fly through an active MOA.

Alert Areas are depicted on charts to warn pilots of a high volume of pilot training or other unusual aerial activity. All operations in an Alert Area are conducted according to Federal Aviation Regulations. Pilots of participating and transit aircraft are equally responsible for collision avoidance. Alert Area A-632E is established because of student jet training.

Controlled Firing Areas have activities which, if not controlled, would be hazardous to non-participating aircraft. They are not charted because activities are suspended immediately when spotter aircraft, radar, or ground lookout positions indicate an aircraft might be approaching the area.

Other airspace includes Military Training Routes, Temporary Flight Restrictions, Parachute Jump Aircraft Operations, Published VFR Routes, Terminal Radar Service Areas, and National Security Areas.

Military Training Routes are mutually developed by the FAA and the Department of Defense. They are generally established below ten thousand feet MSL for operations at speeds above 250 knots. Terminal and sectional charts show MTR's used under VFR as VR. And those flown under instrument flight rules as I-R.
Those MTR's with segments above fifteen hundred feet AGL are identified by a three-digit number. MTR's flown entirely below fifteen hundred feet AGL are identified by a four-digit number. Although pilots are not prohibited from flying on a military training route, you should be extremely vigilant when flying on, across, or near an MTR. You can check the status of an MTR by contacting flight service.

Temporary Flight Restrictions may be imposed to protect persons or property in the air and on the ground. This may be to provide a safe environment for disaster relief aircraft and prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing and other aircraft in the area. Temporary Flight Restrictions and limitations are also implemented in areas visited or travelled by the President, Vice President and other public figures. Presidential TFR's may be stationary during a visit or move along with the president as he travels.  Check the NOTAM's for the latest information.  Violation of this airspace could result in the use of deadly force.

Temporary flight limitations in the proximity of space flight operations provide protection from hazards to pilots and space flight crews.  Notification of temporary flight restrictions or limitations is made by NOTAM's. TFR's also exist around major sporting events below three thousand feet and within three nautical miles.  So, check the sports schedule before you go off sightseeing over the stadium. Since TFR's can pop up at anytime, it's a good idea to check with Flight Service or other official TFR sources shortly before any flight.  This will ensure that there are no TFR's along the route.

Parachute Jump Areas are listed in the Chart Supplement.  The pilot of a jump aircraft should be talking to ATC and should announce his intentions on the local advisory frequency. These communications should include his position, altitude, and the time that the jump will begin and end.  Needless to say, alertness in these areas is paramount and the use of good common sense is necessary.

The FAA has published routes to aid pilots flying under, around, and through complex Class B airspace.  These are; VFR Flyways, VFR Corridors, and Class B Airspace Transition Routes. Charted VFR Flyways were created so that pilots could travel safely in areas heavily traversed by large turbine-powered aircraft.  These flyways help the pilot plan flights into, out of, through, and near complex terminal airspace, avoiding altogether flying into Class B airspace. Pilot compliance with recommended flyways and associated altitudes is strictly voluntary.

VFR Corridors are like a tunnel through Class B.  An aircraft can operate in these corridors without a clearance from or communication with ATC. They are similar to VFR flyways except that they have specific vertical and lateral boundaries which must be followed by all participating aircraft. Because of the high volume of traffic in Class B, it is necessary to fly these corridors with extreme caution. An example of this can be found in the Los Angeles Class B airspace. Refer to the Special Flight Rules Area section of the terminal area chart for specific operating rules.

Class B airspace Transition Routes are similar, except that an ATC clearance is required. They are specific flight courses depicted on Terminal Area charts for transiting the Class B airspace.  Unlike the former published VFR routes, transition routes include specific ATC assigned altitudes. On your initial contact with ATC give them your position, altitude, route name desired, and direction of flight.

Another type of airspace is the Terminal Radar Service Area, called a TRSA. TRSAs are depicted on VFR charts with grey rings. There are only a few TRSAs left. As the name implies, radar traffic advisory service from ATC is available near a terminal in a TRSA. However, whether you get this service or call ATC within the boundaries of the TRSA is up to you.  No ATC communication is required to fly in a TRSA. You're likely to find class D airspace around the primary airport in a TRSA . . . Keep in mind that pilot adherence to the rules in the Class D areas is not optional.

The last remaining category of 'Other Airspace' is called a National Security Area.  Wherever there is a need for increased security on the ground, a National Security Area is created to protect it. Pilots are requested to voluntarily avoid flying through these areas. Pilots are also asked to avoid flight over power plants, dams, refineries, and military facilities even if they are not marked as national security areas.

If you wanted to fly into the U-S from the Bahamas, You would travel through our Air Defense Identification Zone...ADIZ for short. The FAA defines ADIZ as, an area of airspace, over land or water, in which the ready identification, location, and control of civil aircraft is required in the interest of national security. An ADIZ is depicted on Sectional charts by a magenta line bounded by rows of double dots.  It exists along the coastline and the border of Mexico.  Its distance from our borders varies, and for a number of miles, is right on the border between Mexico and the U.S.

Before takeoff, pilots should file either an IFR or Defense VFR flight plan with flight service.  Filing a normal VFR flight plan or air filing may get you intercepted for positive identification by military aircraft. To fly in an ADIZ you need a two-way radio and a transponder equipped with altitude reporting capability.  You must make position reports to ATC. If you filed a D-VFR flight plan, you must report your time, position, and altitude to the appropriate agency, such as ATC, before you enter the ADIZ. If you are departing from within the ADIZ or so close to it that you would enter it in less than fifteen minutes, make your report before you leave or right after you are in the air.

In addition to the normal requirements for operating within a land-based ADIZ, you must report landing or leaving the ADIZ if you are flying too low for radar coverage. If you are unable to comply with all the requirements, don't fly into the area.  Pilots entering an ADIZ without authorization or who fail to follow all the requirements, risk interception by military fighter aircraft.

For heightened security, the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules Area was created.  It extends from the surface to but not including eighteen thousand feet MSL and encompasses some twenty eight hundred square miles. Special flight rules provide for general aviation operations within the area.  Before entering the airspace, you must file and activate a flight plan and contact ATC for a transponder code.  VFR pilots must file a D.C. SFRA flight plan.  This is in addition to any traditional flight plan that the pilot would normally file.
At the heart of the D.C. Special Flight Rules Area is a Flight Restricted Zone with even more stringent requirements.  If you enter the zone without authorization, you will be intercepted - and potentially shot down - by military aircraft.  So don't even think about it!

A National Capitol Region Visual Warning System has been developed to warn pilots that they are violating the D.C. SFRA.  The warning system uses low-level laser beams of alternating red and green lights.  These lights are safe to look at and can be seen up to fifteen miles away during the day and twenty miles at night.  Unfortunately, the light cannot penetrate visible moisture.  Multiple laser sites provide coverage to the entire D.C. SFRA.  Each site can illuminate and track a particular aircraft. If you see this, you should immediately contact ATC or call on one two one point five, and turn to exit the area. A pilot can easily avoid flying through the D.C. Special Flight Rules Area by using the many VOR's located in the vicinity.

If you want to fly within sixty nautical miles of the Washington D.C. VOR / DME, you must complete a special awareness training program and hold a certificate of training completion. You can find this requirement in 14 CFR 91.161. To get this free training, visit the FAA's website at www.faasafety.gov.  After you complete the program, print out your certificate of completion and keep it with you in case you are asked to show it to an approved official.

If you want to fly in and out of these three Washington D.C. airports, you must apply for and be issued a personal identification number.  This requires fingerprinting and a background check. We've told you a lot about airspace – there's a lot to remember in preparing for the knowledge and oral portions of the test.  But more importantly, this is information you will use just about every time you fly.


























































21. Air Facts: Finding the Logic
There is but one reason for the multitude of airspace designations, their purpose is to prevent conflicts between high performance airplanes, usually airline or military, and airplanes that aren’t quite so swift. 

When there is such a mix, the concept of see and avoid doesn't work quite as effectively. In a faster airplane there's just not nearly as much time to see and avoid. 

With that logic in mind, just consider where airliners, for example, are most likely to fly and you can be sure to find some restriction on the airspace there. 

Class B airspace surrounds the busiest airline airports. Transponders with Mode C altitude reporting are required above 10,000 feet because most high-performance airplanes fly above that level. 

These are not rules that were adapted haphazardly. Unfortunately, most came after a serious accident. We must learn from such. 

There was once a collision above 18,000 feet involving two airliners, one of them was flying IFR and one was flying VFR. 

The horse was out of the barn, but a rule requiring all aircraft above 18,000 feet to fly IFR closed the door. 

In the late sixties there were three collisions between general aviation aircraft and airline aircraft near terminal airports. And soon after that terminal control areas and airport radar service areas came into being. 

It's no secret that airspace requirements have brought more complexity to flying, but that is life. Flying is like many other things. 

To make it safer and more useful to more people, it was necessary to increase regulations. If we're going to protect our access to the airspace, we have to be responsible users. 

All it requires is knowledge of the airspace rules and adherence to rules regulating the use of the airspace, plus a good scan for other aircraft, and hopefully a Mode C transponder in every trainer to continuously give controllers information on position and altitude. 

You are lucky, too. The airspace system is today probably about as complex as it will get for awhile.

You'll learn it early and thoroughly and when you hear some old timer grumbling about how complicated it has become, you can scratch your head and wonder what's wrong with him.














22. Wrap Up - Going Places
Here we are again at the end of another volume.  You have passed another milestone: you're beginning to pilot your craft from place to place. As the old saying goes, "If you don't learn something from each flight, you're not paying attention." In your logbook, under remarks, log what you learned and the circumstances surrounding that lesson. So, learn from each flight, have fun, and until we meet again, I'm Rob Reider, so long.</string>
